animeDescription	"b""A girl has loved GG Bond the little pig hero ever since she was a little child. For GG Bond is nothing more than a children's story. Her overbearing parents pressured her into academics well beyond that of sensibility. As she suffers depression she touches a drawn mural she did of GG Bond on her bedroom wall. It opens a portal and she teleports into GG Bond's world. The worlds start to blur, and things she draws on the wall appear within the other world. Eventually she gets trapped and they have to find a way to get her back home."""
