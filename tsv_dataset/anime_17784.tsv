animeDescription	"Airi Akizuki loves to start the morning with sexual fulfillment. When her stepfather Kouzou Akizuki sneaks up on her in her sleep, she feels truly alive. Loaded up to the brim, Airi wakes up fresh, energetic, and ready to face the world.

It is a crisp summer day when Kouzou takes his stepdaughter and her friend, Sana Kuranaka, to the cinema. However, the blissfulness of the date is jeopardized when both Kouzou and Sana fall asleep, leaving Airi alone in the dark room. She gets assaulted by one of her school teachers but has to do her best to stay quiet and not express her pleasure to avoid waking her father up. The assailant leaves his victim drenched in sweat and moaning from satisfaction, promising to return soon. To Airi's horror, she finds herself looking forward to their next meeting.
