animeDescription	"b'Uruno, a useless wolf, is on the road searching for a new place to call home. He soon comes upon a whole forest full of ""useless animals""-- that is, animals that don\'t live up to their species\' usual character. After a short fight with the smoking, bad-tempered rabbit, Usahara, Uruno decides that he wants to move on... but changes his mind upon meeting Chiiko, a clumsy cheetah girl. It\'s love at first sight for Uruno, and after deciding to stay for her, he continues to hope that even though he\'s a good-for-nothing, he\'ll win her over someday. That is, if living with the other strange residents of the forest-- including the aformentioned smoking rabbit, a sake-drinking unicorn, a near-sighted eagle, an orca that cannot swim, and a shy pegasus --doesn\'t get to him first.'"
