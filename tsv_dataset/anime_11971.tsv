animeDescription	"An intense wrestling match takes place between Yellow and Orange. Pulling out all the stops, they attack each other with all they haveâ€”German suplexes, snaps, groin kicks, tosses, and headlocks are all fair game. Only the side that can pin down the other for three seconds will be the winner, and they will both go all-out to seize the prize!
