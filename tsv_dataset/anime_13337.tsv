Two girls, who were struck by the light of the stage in this play, exchanged their destinies.\n\n""Two people\'s stars, waiting on stage.""\n\nTo burn out ordinary fun and joy and fulfill our destinies. A destiny to become a blast furnace at just 5 years old... what a danger.\n\nEventually the two will meet again.
