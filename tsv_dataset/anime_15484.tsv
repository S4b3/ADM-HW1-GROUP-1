Doubutsu Mura no Shouboutai	OVA	1	1972-01-01 00:00:00		81			15484	18001	A fire safety anime involving animals in an anime village. It teaches how to use electrical appliances and what to look out for so that electrical fires do not occur. The anime was commissioned by the Japan Insurance Association, as at the time Japan's economic miracle was rapidly changing the average life of a Japanese citizen. Families who used to live in a simple wooden home suddenly had the luxuries of TV, refrigerators, kotatsu, rice cookers, etc. Unfortunately the rapid progression left a gap of ignorance which led to many fires most commonly from leaving heat-generating products unattended as well as overloading sockets.
