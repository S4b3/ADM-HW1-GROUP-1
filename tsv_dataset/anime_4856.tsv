animeDescription	"b'Yuuri Mito is a typical, normal Japanese teenager.  He goes to school, works on people\'s motorcycles and performs exorcisms.  Okay, that last part\'s a little bit unusual, but his family lives in a shrine and they do that sort of thing.  Still, you would think he\'d know enough to be careful with an ancient relic he finds in the woods, especially when a mysterious goddess appears and tells him to leave it alone.  Unfortunately, despite Mito\'s best efforts, the seal gets broken anyway and a number of dangerous ""tayuti"" that it held in stasis get loose.  This is bad.  Mito also ends up with a beautiful goddess girl who decides that she\'s going to marry him.  This might not be so bad. if he wasn\'t already caught up in the middle of a war between the entities he\'s released.  The flesh may be weak but the spirit\'s more than willing to compensate. \n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)'"
