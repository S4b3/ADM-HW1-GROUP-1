animeDescription	"The monkeys are up to no good again, but this time they're on the ""heroes"" side. Performing no good magic shows, cloning themselves with a ninja Jutsu and filling UFO catchers with themselves are just a few of the tricks they're pulling, while at the same time trying to adapt themselves to the human lifestyle. "
