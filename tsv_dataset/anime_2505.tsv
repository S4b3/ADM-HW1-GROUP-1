animeDescription	"Humans live their lives driven by ambition and greed, prepared to kill their own kind with no hesitation. Since the beginning of humanity, wars have raged on throughout the human world, with the other races watching on.

A victim of one war and orphaned, Ashleen was saved by the lord of the werewolves, Muzaka. Muzaka had abandoned his duties as lord and left the werewolf clan, travelling with Ashleen to secure her happiness. However, during his absence, members of Muzaka's species began orchestrating further wars on humans, disgusted by Muzaka's compassion. A secret and powerful organization established itself in the human realm, intending to manipulate Muzaka. When he is misinformed by the Union, Muzaka starts directing his rage toward the humans. Can his only friend, Cadis Etrama Di Raizel, the Noblesse, stop Muzuka's madness?

Set 820 years before the events of Noblesse, Noblesse: Pamyeol-ui Sija depicts the tragic history of Muzaka, and how it led to the Noblesse's indefinite slumber.
