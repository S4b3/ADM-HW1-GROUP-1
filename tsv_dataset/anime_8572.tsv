animeDescription	"The pinnacle of gag manga as well as one of Akatsuka Fujio's most renowned works, ""Tensai Bakabon"" returns after 18 years since its last anime with Director Hosokawa Toru's new original story!

Bakabon and his family, who made the phrase ""This is how it should be"" famous, are back along with the eccentric cast of Mr. Policeman, Rerere no Ojisan and Eel-Dog letting loose in a much more modern setting!

The new frontier of ""Bakabon"" that'll take place in a late-night slot is about to begin, 10 years after Akatsuka Fujio's death.
