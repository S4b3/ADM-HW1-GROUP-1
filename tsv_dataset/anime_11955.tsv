animeDescription	"b'After the Ice Queen brings eternal winter to the land of Nariadia, the only hope to restore balance is to gather human warriors and give them the power of Naria crystals. For this reason, Animaru has chosen the middle schoolers Urara, Inaho, and Hanabi as warriors. The girls, however, are much more focused on mocking the events happening around them and trying to earn money as idols.\n\nWhen the Ice Queen\'s familiars appear, they use the ""Ice Mirror"" to trick the girls into performing ridiculous skits. Will Urara, Inaho, and Hanabi ever step up and embrace their roles as magical girls, or will their antics prove too distracting to themselves?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n'"
