TV	Unknown	2021-10-03 00:00:00		2332	6.32	313	7108	9027	"The new series continues the Pretty Series' conceptual motifs of song, dance, and fashion, and it also adds the theme of magic. Middle-school first-year student Matsuri Hinoya loves festivals, and she dreams of one day being able to star in ""PriMagi,"" a magic-like form of stage entertainment borne from song, dance and fashion. That day arrives when the hyper-spirited, trouble-making magician Myamu arrives from the magical realm and scouts Matsuri for PriMagi. Together, the two compete with rivals to rise to the top of PriMagi.
