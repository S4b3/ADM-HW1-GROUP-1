animeDescription	"b'The world of dreams can be an incredible window into the psyche, showing one\'s deepest desires, aspirations, and repressed memories. One hopeful tech lab has been developing the ""DC Mini,"" a device with the power to delve into the dreams of others. Atsuko Chiba and Kosaku Tokita have been tirelessly working to develop this technology with the hopes of using it to deeply explore patients\' minds and help cure them of their psychological disorders.\n\nHowever, having access to the deepest corners of a person\'s mind comes with a tremendous responsibility. In the wrong hands, the DC Mini could be used as a form of psychological terrorism and cause mental breakdowns in the minds of targets. When this technology is stolen and people around them start acting strangely, Atsuko and Kosaku know they have a serious problem on their hands. Enlisting the help of Officer Konakawa, who has been receiving this experimental therapy, they search both the real and dream worlds for their mental terrorist.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
