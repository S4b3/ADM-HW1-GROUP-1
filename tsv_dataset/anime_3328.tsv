The room begins to fill up even more, with Grell\'s unconventional harem expanding to include a pair of Phantomhive servants; the English branch manager of a Chinese trading company, Lau; the promiscuous Viscount Druitt; the Queen\'s butler, Ash Landers; and even the royal master-servant pair, Prince Soma and Agni.
