animeDescription	"b'Princess Sapphire is a girl raised as a Prince. Through the mischief of an angel, the princess is born with both a girl\'s body and boy\'s mind. Since there is no boy successor in her kingdom, Sapphire is raised as a boy, but evil ministers try to reveal her secret. Unable to put up with the kind of vicious conduct prevailing in the kingdom, Sapphire disguises herself as ""Princess Knight"" and wields her sword of justice.\n\nThis is an animated version of the girls\' manga featuring Sapphire\'s romance and adventure, which marked the first made-for-TV animated program geared towards girls in Japan.\n\n(Source: Official site)'"
