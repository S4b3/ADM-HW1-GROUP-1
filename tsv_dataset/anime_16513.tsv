animeDescription	Kaijuu Sakaba is a real tavern where kaijuu costumes from the Ultraman franchise are on display. Events are held where people can dine with the actors dressed in the kaijuu costumes. In honor of Kaijuu Sakaba's grand re-opening in Kawasaki and opening of a second tavern in Osaka this anime was made to focus on the kaijuu working at a tavern and the tribulations that come with it.
