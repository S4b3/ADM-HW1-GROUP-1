animeDescription	b'An unfortunate accident befalls Naoki Shindou and his whole class when lightning strikes the airplane they were traveling in for their overseas trip. The only ones able to survive are himself, his classmates Momoka Kiriyama and Kana Miyamura, their teacher Sanae Nakazono, and the flight attendant Asami Kakinuma. Now stranded on an island and far from rescue, it might prove to be too challenging to keep their sexual instincts at bay.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'
