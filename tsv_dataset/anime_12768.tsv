animeDescription	"b'A fifth-year elementary student named Eiji Toomatsu, and his ""inspiration"" buddy, a dog named Pochirou. One day Eiji finds a mysterious book called the ""Pikachin Research Book,"" and learns about the seven tools that make up the Pikachin Kit. Eiji presses a button inside the research book, and immediately a ""Future Amazon"" delivery arrives at his door with the kit. Eiji uses the blueprints included in the box to assemble the kit, but it seems as though 1% part of the kit is still missing. \n\nIn the franchise, the word ""Pikachin"" means the flash of inspiration or insight one gets about a new project, similar to the visual of a lightbulb turning on above one\'s head when someone has an idea. The concept of the franchise is ""invention is 99% plastic models, 1% inspiration."" \n\n(Source: ANN)'"
