animeDescription	"The Tsunashi couple is as lively and offbeat as ever. Hardcore otaku shut-in Hajime and workaholic office lady Kaoru still get themselves into hilarious situations thanks to both their own eccentric natures and the bizarre group of friends surrounding them.

After learning about Kaoru's pregnancy, Hajime works harder than ever to become a good husband and a worthy father. Meanwhile, Kaoru reflects on their relationship and remembers all of the trials and tribulations that brought them closer. The two of them continue to put their best foot forward in their lives and their marriageâ€”all for the sake of long-lasting, selfless love.
