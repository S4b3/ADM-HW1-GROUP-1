animeDescription	"b""Lu Jin Nian and Qiao An Hao are a newly married couple\xe2\x80\x94unfortunately, neither of them are willing participants. Now husband and wife, Qiao An Hao establishes a few ground rules: no one can know that they are married, their cohabitation is top-secret information, and under no circumstances is Lu Jin Nian permitted to touch her. As a result, their marriage remains strictly superficial.\n\nBehind their broken union, however, there is a long and complicated history. A chance encounter while seeking shelter from the rain led to the lives of Lu Jin Nian and Qiao An Hao getting intertwined. But as fate would have it, the date also marked the moment Qiao An Hao's sister fell madly in love with the stoic and mysterious Lu Jin Nian. With emotional stakes flying high, the years leading up to this marriage have been long and complicated\xe2\x80\x94but never boring. And even now, despite their long-standing friendship, the newlyweds are no closer to understanding each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
