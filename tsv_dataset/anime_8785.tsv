animeDescription	"An animated commercial for Kao Biore Sarasara Powder Sheets focuses less on a personal hygiene routine, instead opting to tug at viewers' heartstrings. The ad stars three high school friends, one a flutist named Mina and the other a burgeoning photographer named Akane. Mina finds herself getting wistful as the school year is drawing to a close but through the encouragement of her friends (and some well-timed product placement) she's reinvigorated to make the year the best it can be.
