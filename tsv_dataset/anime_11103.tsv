Twinkle Heart: Gingakei made Todokanai	OVA	1	1986-12-05 00:00:00		1091	5.21	367	11103	10931	"Love, Heaven's greatest treasure went missing and to get it back, the Great God decides to send his two daughters Lemon and Cherry, as well as their governess Berry to find it. However, their search doesn't go so well, mainly because they decide they like it at planet Earth and prefer to work in a hamburger shop (Sic!).

In the one-episode OVA, the girls end up searching for the Love treasure on an exotic planet, however they find magical living plushies instead, having to fight their way through them to recover ""Essence of Life,"" which an evil organisation wants to use for nefarious purposes.
