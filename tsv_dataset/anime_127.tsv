On one such day, however, a massive landslide is spotted on the hill where Kobayashi and Tooru first met\xe2\x80\x94a clear display of a dragon's might. When none of the dragons they know claim responsibility, the perpetrator herself descends from the skies: Ilulu, the radical Chaos Dragon with monstrous power rivaling that of Tooru.\n\nSickened by Tooru's involvement with humans, Ilulu resorts to the typical dragon method of resolving conflict\xe2\x80\x94a battle to the death. Despite such behavior, she becomes intrigued by Kobayashi's ability to befriend dragons and decides instead to observe just what makes Kobayashi so special.
