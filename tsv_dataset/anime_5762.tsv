animeDescription	"Young millionaire Laocorn Gaudeamus is on a crusade to recover six pieces of armour said to give the user the powers of Marsâ€”the legendary God of War. Fearing that her twin brother is slowly losing his sanity with every armour piece he collects, Sulia runs to Terry, Andy, Joe and Mai to form their own global crusade to stop Laocorn from opening a potential Pandora's Box and releasing an uncontrollable form of destruction.
