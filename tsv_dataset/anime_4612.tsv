The new mayor of Futaba Town, Kasukabe-City, Saitama Prefecture, Mamoru Shizan promotes ecology activities, but his true identity is the leader of an eco-terrorist organization ""SKBE: Save Keeping Beautiful Earth"", and he launches a plan to transform human into animals by making them take a drink to change into animals. By taking the drink, Shinnosuke\'s father, Hiroshi changes into a chicken, and his mother changes into a panther. With a mystery woman Victoria, the Nohara Family and half-animalized members of Kasukabe Defense Forces fight against SKBE to stop Shizen\'s plan. \n\n(Source: Manabu Tsuribe)'"
