animeDescription	"A kind and reliable older sister, Mizushiro Ayaka.
A younger childhood friend and now my girlfriend, Tsurutani Ayaka.
While I'm happily getting along with the two, I wasn't satisfied.
That is because I have a hobby that I must keep hidden.

I want to do S&M.

I secretly buy tools for my personal use - stare at it, touch it.
And then one day as I was expelling myself of my urges, I noticed
that someone had entered my room and saw the secret.

Let's try setting a trap...

I turn to see who discovered my secret.
And so, our abnormal relationship began.

Based on the erotic game by Noesis.
