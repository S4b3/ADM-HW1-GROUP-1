animeDescription	"b'The new film\'s story is set in Okoya Forest, a Pok\xc3\xa9mon paradise protected by strict rules that forbid outsiders from setting foot inside. The film centers on Koko, a boy who was raised by Pok\xc3\xa9mon and also considers himself as one, treating the Mythical Pok\xc3\xa9mon Zarude as his father. Ash and Pikachu encounter Koko during an adventure. The film focuses on the theme of a ""human raised by Pok\xc3\xa9mon,"" instead of the previous films\' focus of the ""bond between a human trainer and their Pok\xc3\xa9mon.""\n\n(Source: ANN)'"
