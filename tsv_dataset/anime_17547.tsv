animeDescription	"After the third world war, nations devastated by biological warfare no longer have the ability to protect the wastelands, so the defense of these territories is left to private military companies like Griffin & Kryuger, whose android soldiers or ""tactical dolls"" are tasked with fighting the rogue android army of Sangvis Ferri. Now M4A1, the indecisive but potentially capable leader of the elite ""Anti-Rain"" team must protect her comrades in a series of operations to try and regain the upper hand against Sangvis Ferri. "
