animeDescription	b'Year 2055, four years after the events in Danball Senki W. LBXs have become the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest hobby, big enough for pro leagues to be established, and people to make their entire living off being an LBX player. 14-year-old Arata is a new transfer student at Kamui Daimon Integrated Academy on Kamui Island, near Japan. Known to be the most prestigious institution in the world for raising LBX players and mechanics, entrance to the academy requires an extremely competitive hurdle of being the champion of at least three official tournaments. Along with other members of his platoon, they face rivals and delve into the secrets lurking within the academy.\n\n(Source: ANN)'
