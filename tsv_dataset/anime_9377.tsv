animeDescription	"b'In a world of magic and monsters, Krylancelo Finrandi and his foster sister Azalea Cait-Sith were once promising students of sorcery, prodigies at the famous Tower of Fangs. But an experiment gone horribly wrong warps Azalea\'s appearance, trapping her in the form of a dragon.\n\nElders at the Tower\xe2\x80\x94more interested in preserving their reputation rather than their students\' lives\xe2\x80\x94drive off the transformed Azalea and cover up the incident. Outraged, Krylancelo strikes out on his own, taking the new name of ""Orphen"" and vowing to return Azalea to her normal state.\n\nFive years later, Orphen\'s quest has stalled. A chance encounter brings him face to face with Azalea again, but he still has no way to restore her body. And with a hostile group of sorcerers hunting her down, he may be running out of time. The past and present collide as Orphen tries to find how to save Azalea from their former teachers and friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n'"
