animeDescription	"Official music video for the song ""Star""t. It is the 46th song in the franchise. With a feature on Nanase Hagiwara, Nadeshiko Igarashi, and Minae Ono we assumed that it was once again about ""Maigahara Koukou Keion-bu,"" an after school club band with them. But they now have a new club member called Hana Katsuragi. Together the four of them have now renamed the band to HaNaMiNa which uses the first syllables of their names (in order: Hana, Nanase, Minae, and Nadeshiko)."
