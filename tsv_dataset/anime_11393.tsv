animeDescription	"The oldest recovered film by Noburou Oofuji that combines paper cutout animation with live action shots.

In front of a girl with the traditional Japanese hairstyle, a small man on a desk says, ""women descended from tobacco."" The girl laughs at him and traps him under a glass. The angry man puffs on a cigarette in a pipe and blows smoke at the girl. The girl takes the cigarette from the man and puts it under her book. When the man threatens her with a gun, the girl throws the cigarette into the yard. The man becomes really angry and tries to shoot her, but the gun does not fire. In the end, the man starts telling her about the beginning of tobacco.
