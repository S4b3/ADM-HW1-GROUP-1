animeDescription	"The ""Blue-eyed Dolls"" were given in 1927 by the USA, under the leadership of Dr. Gulick, to Japanese elementary schools and kindergartens for the purpose of Japanese-American friendship.

About 12,000 ""Blue-eyed Dolls"" were given by the USA. However, with the outbreak of the Pacific War (World War II) in 1941, a great number of the ""Blue-eyed Dolls,"" who were considered to be ""dolls of the enemy country,"" were disposed of by being burned or by being stabbed with bamboo spears. 

This is the story of children trying to rescue the doll.
