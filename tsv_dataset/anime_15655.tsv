animeDescription	b'The theme came from the Japanese unique folklore, Red Uncleanness or defilement with blood. A girl, whose thinking pattern jumps at a leap without any train of thought, confines her various thoughts in the other side of the mirror and inside the sliding doors to go outside.\n\n(Source: Geidai Animation)'
