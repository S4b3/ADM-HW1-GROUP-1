animeDescription	"Just when you thought that no one could drive harder, move faster, and hang lower than Kisaku, here comes the continued adventures of the original Letch. Thanks to Shusaku's position at an all girls' school, his story is packed with more girls, more perversion, and twice the lesbianism that Kisaku could ever handle.
