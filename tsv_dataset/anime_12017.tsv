animeDescription	"Adapted from a short tale from self-made animator Bu Sifan, writer and director of Dahufa, the feature introduces a fictional golden-colored flower, which possesses the magical ability to debauch humans who get too close to it.

As the flower only chooses kindhearted people as hosts, a group of martial artists who want to eradicate the plants face a dilemma: Should one kill good people for rescuing men from sin?
