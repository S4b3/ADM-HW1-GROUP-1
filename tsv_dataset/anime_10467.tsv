animeDescription	b'Biohazard 4D Executor was a 20 minute CG movie that people in Japan could see in a special theater. \n\nThough the CG was primitive, (the rendering and models aren\xe2\x80\x99t much better than that seen in Resident Evil 2, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not on par with Resident Evil 3) it told the story enough. Below is a summary of the events within the 20 minute movie. \n\nThe story focuses on an elite unit of 5 UBCS members, sent into Raccoon City to try and rescue Dr. Cameron. An Umbrella scientist lost in all the confusion. The UBCS team, consisting of members Rodrigo, Roger, Klaus, Ed and Norman, have a GPS device used to track down Dr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s last known location, which is near a large food factory. \n\nUpon entering the factory they are attacked by a large creature, a sort of hybrid between a Tyrant and the more evolved forms of Nemesis. \n\n(Source: rehorror.net) '
