Shissou Word	Music	1	2017-12-29 00:00:00		854	6.3	358	7192	11559	"'Can't you do normal things?' Aah, I wonder how many times I've been asked this. I deem 'normal' to be a word with an awfully cruel ring to it sometimes. Even when I'm intending to do my best, I look like I'm slacking off to other people. At times like these, I logically end up suffocated by those words. If only I could become 'normal'. If only I could do things like 'normal'. The protagonist of this song is also afraid of 'normal' and loses her 'words'. 'I want to disappear for good.' Just what 'words' are delivered to her as she wishes for this? I want you, who can't 'act normal', to listen to this one song as well.
