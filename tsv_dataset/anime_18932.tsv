animeDescription	"b""Based on Nagai Gou's manga. \n\nThe life of a young heiress is endangered by the will and ambition of Tokugawa Tsunai and his henchmen. The young woman, who calls herself Kurenai Mitanosuke, loves to dress as a samurai. She certainly should be more wary of her two obsessed bodyguards (Kaki and Suki) than of the danger that threatens her because, without her knowledge, her life is protected by a mysterious one-eyed shinobi...\n\n(Source: AniDB) """
