animeDescription	"b""After thousands of years of hard work, Jesus Christ and Gautama Buddha decide that they have earned a vacation and descend from the heavens to rent a small apartment in Tokyo, Japan. As the pair struggles to live incognito, they enjoy the luxuries of modern society, such as amusement parks, and limited-time store sales. Jesus and Buddha take the time to celebrate each other's holidays, watch the changing of the seasons, and explore their new surroundings. Saint\xe2\x98\x86Oniisan follows the two religious figures as they meet new people and face the everyday challenges that come with living in Tokyo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
