animeDescription	"b""Har\xc3\xa9's family receives a video letter from Weda's home in the city. Witnessing how sad and lonely Weda's mother and Bel are without her, Weda decides to take Har\xc3\xa9 and Guu back to the city for a while. After Har\xc3\xa9 complains about being bored and lonely without his friends in the jungle (as part of his plot to persuade his mother to take him back), Weda decides to send him to a private school in the city, where he instanly falls in love with a pretty girl named Rita. But, of course, Guu wants part of the action too.\n\n(Source: ANN)"""
