A microcosm of peculiar origins, ""Mirror Kyoto.""

A small incident causes a young girl, Koto, to wander into this world.

She runs into a mysterious monk, gets chased around by a tech-obsessed girl, and heartily enjoys her chaotic and colorful new life, but meanwhile, out of sight, a certain plan is being set into motion...
