animeDescription	b'I woke up to find I was in an old house deep in the snowy mountains. They said I was carried into there with my head being bruised. There were a mistress, who was surrounded by books and pictures and loved camera, and the four maids who smiled sadly. They seemed to know everything. However, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou brought the time into this house where time had stopped\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThe gear began to work as if it was led by the folklore of spiriting away talked in the candle light. At midnight, the big clock that had stopped for decades rang thirteen times.\n\nWhen a dark blue shadow crawled out from the depth of the well were wandering around, snivel of the maids came in the dark. Was it an ecstasy or else?\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)'
