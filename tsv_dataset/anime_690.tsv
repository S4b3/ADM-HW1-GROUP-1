animeDescription	"Ai Enma and her companions continue to offer their service of revenge against those who have wronged others, and the price is as steep as everâ€”for damning the offender to hell, the person exacting vengeance is sent to the abyss as well. As they cast soul after soul into the darkness, a new sinister force is watching them: a little girl named Kikuri.

While Ai continues her duties, she meets a boy named Takuma Kurebayashi, known as the ""Devil's Child"" because of the horrific events that occur around him. Unfortunately, Takuma's reputation leads the townspeople to use him as a scapegoat for those who have been ferried off to hell. When things quickly spiral out of control, Ai must find a way to bring an end to this senseless violence, as it poses a threat to her very existence.
