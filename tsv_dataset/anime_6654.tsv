animeDescription	"b'Waking up transformed into a beautiful girl might be the stuff of some guys\' fantasies, but when the suddenly effeminatized Natsuru is informed by a stuffed tiger that he\'s now a Kampfer, a mystical fighter who has to fight other Kampfers in female form, his life becomes a living nightmare!\n\nPutting aside the obvious ""plumbing"" issues, Natsuru\'s best childhood friend turns out to swing the other way and SHE has a crush on his new female body. Not complex enough? Natsuru\'s school has separate sections for boys and girls, so he and she are now double enrolled. The rumor-mill has it that he\'s dating herself. And there are other Kampfers attending the school who want to take her out, and he\'s not sure which ones mean ""on a date"" and which ones mean ""permanently."" Oh, and did we mention that some Kampfers use swords and guns?! Hormones, fists, and other body parts will fly as the daring, new gender-bender defender must become a contender or die!\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)'"
