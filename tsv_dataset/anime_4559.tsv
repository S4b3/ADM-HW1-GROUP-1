animeDescription	"b""The operation to find a missing person goes awry when Kakashi Hatake falls victim to a suspicious trap and gets separated from his students Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno. To make matters worse, the trio is ambushed by mysterious ninjas who capture Sakura, prompting Naruto and Sasuke to give chase.\n\nAs the two boys engage in a dangerous battle, not even Sasuke's troubling discovery about the mission can deter them from their endeavor to reunite the team and accomplish their task.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
