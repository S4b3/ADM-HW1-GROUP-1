animeDescription	b'Maid in Heaven is a tart little two episode OVA focusing on the rather sordid relationship between Yuusuke Matsudo and his childhood friend Nagisa, who\xe2\x80\x99s also his newly hired maid. Of course, it would be more accurate to call her his maid/willing sex slave, since when she isn\xe2\x80\x99t cleaning or making food, he\xe2\x80\x99s showing her all the ways to be a true maid. How should a true maid act you ask? By being sexually subservient and promiscuous of course! She\xe2\x80\x99s not quite there yet though, and Yuusuke\xe2\x80\x99s on a mission to train her to be a true maid, ready and willing to please wherever and whenever he so desires!   \n\n(Source: Animetric)'
