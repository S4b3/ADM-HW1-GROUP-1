animeDescription	b'Long ago, one of the supreme beings in the heaven tried to save humanity from the tyranny of the other gods but lost his life. During his last breathe, he passed his soul power so that one day a chosen one may follow his lead and take mankind towards the path of victory from annihilation threat. Thousand of years later, our hero regains power, fights evil nobles, and thus thrives in this new world with his over powered capacities.'
