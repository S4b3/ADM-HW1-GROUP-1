Hangyakusei Million Arthur PV	ONA	1	2018-11-29 00:00:00		1952	5.82	340	9296	9517	"The animated PV for Square Enix's mobile MMORPG, Hangyakusei Million Arthur.

Britain is a land surrounded on all sides by sea. When threatened with an invasion from an unknown enemy, this land quickly falls into chaos. Britain's only hope is the guardian known as Arthur, the one who is chosen by the sacred sword Excalibur.

However, this title wasn't exclusive to just one hero. With the sacred sword deeming challengers worthy, this number quickly grew into the millions. As Arthurs, they fulfill their duty as a guardian, in this never-ending struggle against death. 

On the other hand, there are those who shoulder a different mission from these Arthurs. ""Destroy Excalibur"". These warriors are referred to as AGENT Arthurs. 

To destroy one million Excaliburs, they wield Excalibur. They are Arthurs, yet not Arthurs. This is a tale of rebellion for those struggling to prevent the end of the world.
