animeDescription	b'Immortal arts, magic weapons, magical powers, and the boundless spiritual qi between heaven and earth vanished into obscurity overnight, and all exorcists turned to mere mortals.\n\nThree hundred years later, the Five Hus traversed the pass, it was a prelude to an era of great turmoil in China. They heralded the end of the world, where thousands of drought fiends stalked the night \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 the collapse of the Divine Land is imminent.\n\nFortunately, within this long, dark night where silence had fallen on all magic, a lone star still glistened brightly on the horizon.\n\nThe Heart Lamp appeared, illuminating the vast expanse around it. A sixteen-year-old young man, who will end his life on his twentieth birthday, embarked on a journey to reclaim the spiritual qi of heaven and earth that had been sealed away \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 only four years remain.\n\nThe road ahead was filled with countless thistles and thorns, and it seemed improbable for him to succeed.\n\n'
