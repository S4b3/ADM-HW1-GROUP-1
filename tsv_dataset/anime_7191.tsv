And then one day, Asuka, whose grandfather is a legendary shinobi, encounters an ancient evil being named a ""Youma"" in the back alleys of Tokyo at Christmastime. Where there is light, there is shadow. Over 28 of the strongest and most well-endowed ninjas in history, both good and evil, will collide in a battle to determine true justice.
