animeDescription	"Kimihiro Watanuki can see spirits and other assorted supernatural creatures, which is quite a bothersome ability he strongly dislikes. On the way home one day, while plagued by some spirits, he is inexplicably compelled to enter a strange house. There, he encounters Yuuko, a mysterious woman who claims to be able to rid him of the ability to see and attract the troublesome creaturesâ€”for a price. She demands that he work at her ""store"" that grants wishes to people, and thus begins Watanuki's adventures through weird and wonderful events.
