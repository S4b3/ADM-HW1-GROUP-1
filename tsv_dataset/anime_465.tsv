animeDescription	"The stage sets in a world where guinea pigs became cars.

The car that makes you relax, ""Molcar"".

Having big round eyes, curvy butt and speedy limbs, they always explore the world with their innocent faces.

Even during traffic jams, you can be eased just by looking at the butt of that Molcar in front of you.

Even when they cause trouble, their furry cuteness will somehow make you forgive them!?

Surrounded by situations only met by cars, it's a Mol-animation filled with cure, friendship, adventure and furry actions!
