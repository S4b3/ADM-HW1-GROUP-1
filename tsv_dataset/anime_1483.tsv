animeDescription	"Everywhere around the world, the children sleep. Unaware of danger lurking in the shadows. But tonight, a strange darkness floats in the wind. And the children, one by one, begin to disappear. It seems to be a supernatural force that feeds on their dreams. The evil queen, Badiyanu, and her loyal fairies assist in using the ""Black Dream Hole"" to swallow the earth. It is up to Sailor Moon and the Sailor Soldiers to prevent the approaching Darkness.
