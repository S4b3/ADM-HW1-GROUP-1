animeDescription	"b'Lum doesn\'t need much assistance going ballistic when everyone in Tomobiki gets an invitation to Ataru\'s wedding -- and she\'s not listed as the bride! It seems that some 11 years ago, Ataru played ""Shadow Tag"" with a young girl named Elle and won. Unfortunately, Elle was yet another Alien Princess; and on her planet, if a boy steps on a girl\'s shadow, they have to marry. \nWhen Elle\'s emissary comes to make arrangements, Lum redefines the term ""the atmosphere was electric,"" but to no avail: a force-field now protects Ataru from her high voltage love-zaps. Lum\'s friend Benten suggests a pre-emptive wedding, and they proceed to abduct Ataru and all of the wedding guests, and the stage is set for the shotgun wedding of all time!\n\n(Source: AniDB)'"
