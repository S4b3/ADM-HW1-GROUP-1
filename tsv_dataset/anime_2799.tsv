To ensure the success of the mission, Alice Kisaragi, an exceptional android with a youthful appearance named after the company itself, is assigned to be Roku-gou's travel companion. \n\nUpon their arrival at the outskirts of the kingdom, Alice and Roku-gou encounter Snow, the commander of the country's royal guard. Snow leads the pair to a broken legendary artifact, and Roku-gou seizes the opportunity for a long-awaited promotion at his company and changes the recitation for the sacred ritual to an embarrassing phrase.

Having infiltrated the kingdom's inner circle, Roku-gou must now help his new employer fight against the Demon Lord's Army, all while perpetuating evil deeds as a combatant of the Kisaragi Corporation. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
