His investigation reveals the names of three high school girls\xe2\x80\x94Ayano Yukawa, a gravure model; Misuzu Inami, a public entertainment actress; and Rina Tsubaki, his sister's close friend. His heart filled with vengeance, Ryou kidnaps the three girls and brings them into an abandoned building in the middle of a remote forest.
