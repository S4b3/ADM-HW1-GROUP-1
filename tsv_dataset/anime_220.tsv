animeDescription	"The nation of Tempest is in a festive mood after successfully overcoming the surprise attack from the Blumund Army and the Western Holy Church. Beyond the festivities lies a meeting between Tempest and its allies to decide the future of the Nation of Monsters. The aftermath of the Blumund invasion, Milim Nava's suspicious behavior, and the disappearance of Demon Lord Carrionâ€”the problems seem to keep on piling up.

Rimuru Tempest, now awakened as a ""True Demon Lord,"" decides to go on the offensive against Clayman. With the fully revived ""Storm Dragon"" Veldora, ""Ultimate Skill"" Raphael, and other powerful comrades, the ruler of the Tempest is confident in taking down his enemies one by one until he can face the man pulling the strings.
