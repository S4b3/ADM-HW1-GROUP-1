animeDescription	NHK's Heat Exhibition is an event hosted each year in March which invites individuals with disabilities to submit poetry for the opportunity to have their work featured alongside original artwork by a celebrity. 50 applicants are selected each year. One of the poems submitted by mentally-impaired Megumi Ichimura had a melody added by classically trained Japanese violinist Ikuko Kawai. Accompanied by singer Emiko Shiratori, their song titled Obaachan Moshikashite aired on the Minna no Uta program in April, 2005. The video features a blend of live scenery and animation by Seiichi Hayashi.
