As people's minds are getting dirty, being attracted by the dirty spirits, the monsters break the rule to go to the human world.\n\nTsutomu, a boy who goes to Yokai Elementary School, is suddenly assaulted by monsters. Those who save him from the monsters are Enma-kun, the son of Enma, Yukiko, a snow woman, and Kapaeru.
