animeDescription	b'Almost everyone in our contemporary society is picked up and moved around by someone or something, like in a game of Sugoroku. Those who first do so are our parents. \n\nWe follow a boy who grows up along on Sugoroku board, during which he depends on his parents. His family play the parts of roles in the game - his father rolling the die, and his mother picking him up and placing him he passively goes about his way. But for how long will he let this continue?\n\n(Source: YouTube)'
