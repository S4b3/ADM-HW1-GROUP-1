animeDescription	"Tokine Amino is the young and overburdened secretary of the CEO at a talent agency. One day while cleaning, she is suddenly transported to a strange alternate dimension ruled by a floating piglike creature. The creature, Hacchin, explains that this dimension is called ""Quizun,"" and transforms her outfit before stating that she cannot leave unless she solves a puzzle within five minutes. While Tokine manages to keep a mostly calm composure and solve the puzzle, Hacchin recognizes her talent and decides that the two will meet again. Now Tokine runs the risk of suddenly being transported to Quizun at any time, along with anyone who may be within her vicinity.
