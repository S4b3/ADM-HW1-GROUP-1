animeDescription	"Meet the Demon Patrol: a hotheaded demon prince; a sultry, half-naked ice princess; a lusty frog-demon spy; a talking wizard hat... and one little girl. This rag-tag group has been charged with the protection of Earth from a multitude of demons who would love nothing more than to bring their world crashing down around them. They'll face off against a vengeful squid, a somnambulant kitty cat, a pot full of snakes, a night-stalking deciduous, a hater of crotches, and even a literal butthead! Descend into an unreality filled with pratfalls, lewd behavior, and enough obscure cultural jetsam to drown us all!
