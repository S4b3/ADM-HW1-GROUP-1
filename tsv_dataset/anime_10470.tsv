animeDescription	"b'Three devil girls Aira, Shima, and Hana live in the human world. Leading a dazzling school life with efforts and friendships, they aim to be idols. It\'s a heart-bumping anime climbing that stairs... Not! They don\'t know the answer to ""What is Idol?"" and weaver in the road to becoming an idol with trials and errors. Rocket-sensei will kindly (and sometimes strictly) lead them to become real idols in an unique way... for sure. \n\n(Source: MAL News)'"
