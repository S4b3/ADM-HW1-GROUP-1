She enjoys her worry-free life in Fukui, save for the fragments of images that she sees on occasion.\n\nOn her 18th summer, she meets the transfer student Kakeru Okikura at her school, and then again at her favorite caf\xc3\xa9 called Kazemichi together with all four of her friends. The voices from the future lead Kakeru to Touko, and his arrival disrupts her mediocre existence.
