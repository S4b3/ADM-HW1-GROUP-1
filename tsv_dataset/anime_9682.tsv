animeDescription	"The ""unorthodox hard surreal gag"" comedy centers around the narcissistic (narushi na) Hagito and the masochistic (domazo na) Kei. Together they are ""Nar Doma.""

Hagito is a handsome yet pitiful man with a loli complex. Anytime, anywhere, a mirror is his constant companion. Surrounding him are a host of highly idiosyncratic characters: the diehard masochist Kei, the unnaturally strong yet girlish Totono, the exceedingly stylish working stiff Saitou, and the extraordinarily negative Roku. Even the one normal guy has his own issues.
