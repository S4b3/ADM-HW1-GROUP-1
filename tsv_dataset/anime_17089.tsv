animeDescription	"b'The anime\'s story is set in both a celestial realm of angels and demons, as well as Nippon Cultural Broadcasting in the mortal realm. The angels, who use the power of love to protect the peace of the Earth, have their sight set on the ""Love Nights!"" radio program, so they send rookie angels to Nippon Cultural Broadcasting, and end up fighting the demons that face them. Morikubo, Yoshino, Fukuyama, and Suwabe play the angels and demons in conflict, while Yonaga plays the goddess in the celestial realm who stands neutral in the conflict.\n\n(Source: ANN)'"
