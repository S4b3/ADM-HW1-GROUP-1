animeDescription	"A collaboration campaign between Kraft Parmesan Cheese and World Masterpiece Theater. Eight web shorts were made using seven of the World Masterpiece Theater stories (Flanders no Inu had two episodes); they act as mini side-stories within their respective shows, though Haha wo Tazunete Sanzenri occurs after the show.

An apprentice fairy called Palme connects all the stories together as she uses her magic (aka sprinkling parmesan) to make ""happy pasta."""
