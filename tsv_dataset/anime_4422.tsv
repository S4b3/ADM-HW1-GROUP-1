animeDescription	"b'College student Chitose Karasuma is determined not to do boring things as she enters the adult world. To this end, this bad-mannered beauty barges into a facility that trains would-be voice actors and actresses, somehow landing a job at ""Number One Produce,"" a seiyuu agency managed by her older brother, Gojou. In Chitose\'s mind, she\'s poised for greatness, but finds herself at a loss when she continues to only get minor roles. As she clashes with other girls in the agency, including a cunning airhead and a girl with a Kansai accent, Chitose is about to learn that there\'s more to succeeding in this competitive industry than she imagined.\n\n(Source: ANN)'"
