animeDescription	"b'Based on ""Unico and the Kingdom of the Sun,"" which was newly written as a theater version, this animated film features a battle between the wizard Kukuruku and Unico. Kukuruku builds a castle using dolls transformed from men as building parts. The story revolves around the sorrow and terror of men who have been transfigured into dolls, and a girl named Cherry who wishes to recover the kindness in her brother, who is a student of Kukuruku. This work reminds us of the fact that ""transformation"" or ""transfiguration"" - favorite themes of Tezuka Osamu - involves not only material aspects, but also man\'s immaterial heart.\n\n(Source: Tezuka Osamu\'s Website)'"
