animeDescription	"Burenai Ai de was released on Miku's anniversary. The song is now used for the AR campaign for Rohto Pharmaceutical's new eye drops ""Digi Eye"". Like much of Mitchie's song titles this one has a double meaning, ""ai"" (love) and ""eye"" both being correct translations.

An app was released in August 2014 that would play a partial version of the song and show a 3D Miku dancing on any surface.
