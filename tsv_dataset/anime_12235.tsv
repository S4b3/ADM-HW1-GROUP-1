animeDescription	"Naccio and Pomm have come to Earth from a far-away planet. What they discover, and what viewers of all ages delight in, is fun, fun, fun!
Italian-based, Japanese master animator Fusako Yusaki uses mere clay (plasticine), plus a great deal of off-the-wall imagination, to create a simple, yet captivatingly busy world of play. Naccio and Pomm bounce and bumble through their explorations of everyday settings -- everyday to us Earthlings, that is. For the two aliens, every experience is new and endlessly enjoyable.
