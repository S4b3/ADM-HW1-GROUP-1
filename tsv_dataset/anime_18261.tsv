animeDescription	"Based on an adult PC game by Courreges Ace. 

Takuma has a crush on Megumi, but is unable to confess or date her. When browsing on his phone, he comes across a hypnosis program and decides to try it. Could this be the thing to bring him closer to Megumi? Perhaps it will make her simply obey, which could be a lot of fun too..."
