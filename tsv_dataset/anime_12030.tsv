animeDescription	"Various animated videos for Midori-chan, the mascot of Sammy Co.'s pachislot and pachinko games. The videos are web-exclusive releases on Sammy Co.'s official YouTube channel. Midori-chan was launched in 2016 debuting in her ""Nice to meAt you☆"" video. A 'full' version was released the following year but contains very little recycled footage, essentially giving her two significantly different debut videos. 

The main purpose of Midori-chan is to promote the Myslot (マイスロ) app which allows people to register their gaming through their mobile device which uses QR Codes to let players see and archive their gaming statistics. It also allows users to win prizes, be ranked against others, play minigames (in the app), collect trophies, and find fellow pachinko friends.

Midori-chan has also gone on to have her own digital 4-koma manga (2 different ones), LINE stickers, a book, and apparel line."
