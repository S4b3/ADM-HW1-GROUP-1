Megurigaoka Private High School is a unique and lively place where Yuki enjoys her carefree life as a third-year high school student and member of the School Living Club. The club, consisting of the president Yuuri Wakasa, the athletic Kurumi Ebisuzawa, the mature junior Miki Naoki, the supervising teacher Megumi Sakura, and the club dog Taroumaru, prides itself on making the most of life at school. On top of meeting after classes, the members must live within school grounds, from sleeping over to eating meals.\n\nFrom the manga series of the same name written by Norimitsu Kaihou and illustrated by Sadoru Chiba, Gakkougurashi! follows the adventures of the School Living Club as they live at school to promote independence and self-determination.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'
