animeDescription	"b'A TV show that is so unclear to whom and where it is broadcast. A strange room where the recording and editing is taking place. A middle-aged gentleman like a wax figure sits on a turntable and grabs the microphone as the director signals him to do so. A reading about the mysterious genre ""Ficfyon"" has begun. \'What the heck did we not have time for?\' The monologue of a man sitting in the audience and continuing to talk about his story will soon move into Ficfyon prophecies about the 2000s.\n\n(Source: CaRTe bLaNChe)'"
