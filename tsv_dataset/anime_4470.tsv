The Seven Barian Emperors catch wind of Yuuma and Astral\'s endeavors and begin to collect the cards themselves to achieve their ultimate goal: destroying Astral\'s world in exchange for saving their own.\n\nThough only five of the emperors are present, they unanimously decide on annihilating Astral and Yuuma once and for all.
