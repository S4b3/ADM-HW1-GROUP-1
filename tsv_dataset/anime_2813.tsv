Athena\'s sister Artemis, the Virgin Goddess of the Moon and twin sister of Apollo, makes an elaborate proposal - to restore Seiya\'s physical health in exchange for the supremacy of Sanctuary. Athena accepts and Artemis and her ""Knights of the Sky"" swiftly take control of Sanctuary.

Bronze Saints Hydra Ichi and Unicorn Jabu, and Silver Saint Ophiuchus Shaina have join forces with Artemis and Apollo. \n\n(Source: ANN)'"
