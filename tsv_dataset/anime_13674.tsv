animeDescription	A second collaboration with Town Work. Jobuubu is looking for a job and so is the Chancellor as he was fired from his previous one. The two run into each other on the street after having an unsuccessful job hunt. Chancellor takes Jobuubu back to the Eagle Talon headquarters where they discover that he has the ability to repair hand dryers. The repair not only makes it dries properly but gives the user a sense of pure bliss. Together they team up; Chancellor finds clients while Jobuubu does the repairs. Queen Electronic, one of the manufactures of the hand dryers, gets wind of them and invites them to work on new ideas for their company in order to improve their old products. But a rival company wants to make sure they don't succeed.
