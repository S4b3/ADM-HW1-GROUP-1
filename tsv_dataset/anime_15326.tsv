animeDescription	"b""Apparently inspired largely by Akira Toriyama's popular Dr. Slump, Cybot Robocchi is the story of Robocchi, a fun-loving, mischievous robot with a TV set in his stomach.\n\nRobocchi lives in a peaceful village with various other robots, all created by the eccentric and somewhat lecherous Dr. Art Deko. Although he is an android, Robocchi has a warm, kind heart and is always willing to help out a friend in need. With his human girlfriend Kurumi, he gets into a variety of wacky adventures.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"""
