animeDescription	"The Crown Knights are a bizarre special force to fight to the criminals who threaten the tranquil Card Kingdom. Each one had a special ability. But these Crown Knights must get down and dirty when they run up against two war machines shaped like gigantic chess pieces. The deck is stacked against them, somehow they've got the checkmate these indestructible invaders before the Card Kingdom topples.
