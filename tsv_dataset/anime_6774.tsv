animeDescription	"The sci-fi fantasy series Eden is set thousands of years in the future, where a city known as ""Eden 3"" is inhabited solely by robots whose former masters vanished a long time ago. On a routine assignment, two farming robots accidentally awaken a human baby girl from stasis questioning all they were taught to believeâ€”that humans were nothing more than a forbidden ancient myth. Together, the two robots secretly raise the child in a safe haven outside Eden.
