animeDescription	"In this ukiyoe-style flash anime, Isobe Isobee is a lazy, slacker samurai with big dreams. He lives with his mother, who thinks highly of him. He lays around the house, sneakily looks at Edo-period pornography without his mother noticing, naps at school, but he plans to become a respectable samurai one day!
