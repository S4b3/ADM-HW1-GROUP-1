animeDescription	b'Lately, Hamtaro has been having a strange dream. In the dream, a beautiful princess hamster tearfully asks for help. Hamtaro can\xe2\x80\x99t forget about her, even when he\xe2\x80\x99s awake. One winter day, Laura talks to Hamtaro. She tells him that everyone in the family is going home to her father\xe2\x80\x99s hometown. When Hamtaro tells his friends about it, Maxwell pulls out a Ham-Ham source book. It\xe2\x80\x99s a book on old hamster history. \n\nAccording to the book, there is a \xe2\x80\x9chomeland\xe2\x80\x9d for hamsters called \xe2\x80\x9cHamja Kingdom\xe2\x80\x9d. When the Ham-Hams build a sand castle and recite a spell exactly the way it is written in the book, they are whooshed to the Kingdom. When at last the hamsters reach the bustling Hamja Kingdom of hamsters, the popular King Hamja, the Mini-Hams that they\xe2\x80\x99ve met before in Ham-Ham Land, and many jar spirits called the Mo-Hams appear. A parade begins merrily with singing and dancing! But, the bad magic cat \xe2\x80\x9cSabakunya\xe2\x80\x9d appears suddenly, riding the giant sheep monster \xe2\x80\x9cMee Mee\xe2\x80\x9d, and starts to trample the town. What a disaster! \n\nThe Ham-Hams flee underground. The Ham-Hams are told of the state of the Kingdom and find that Sabakunya has snatched the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Princess Shera, and is pressing her into marriage on the Kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s Founding Day. Sabakunya is trying to take over the country. Something clicks in Hamtaro\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Princess Shera is without a doubt the princess who appeared in his dreams! Hamtaro wants very much to run to the castle where Sabakunya is, and so he and the Ham-Hams enter the castle. In the castle, they encounter danger after danger, and Hamtaro, pursued by Sabakunya\xe2\x80\x99s henchmen, is separated from others. '
