animeDescription	"b'The story is set in 1955 in Kokuga, Hofu City, Yamaguchi Prefecture.\n\nOne thousand years ago it was the site of the ancient capital, Suo no Kuni, and traces of the Heian Period (year 794-1185) are passed down to us in the form of ruins and historical place names.\n\nThe protagonist is Shinko, a third grade elementary school student, who was born and raised in one of the town\'s venerable families. She is a little girl whose characteristic is a strange curl on her forehead (she calls it her ""Mai Mai""), and her love for playing in the fields. On the other hand, her secret joy is to imagine and to daydream about the world of one thousand years ago. Her fantasies travel far into the days of the Heian Period...\n\nOne day, a girl called Kiiko transfers from Tokyo and enters Shinko\'s class. This girl from the big city has difficulty feeling at home in this small town, but gradually her friendship with Shinko deepens.\n\nBefore long, the two of them become engulfed in a strange incident of one thousand years earlier...?!'"
