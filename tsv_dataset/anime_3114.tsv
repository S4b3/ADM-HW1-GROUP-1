animeDescription	"After a successful Ayanagi Festival, Yuuta Hoshitani and the members of Team Ootori celebrate the beginning of a new year and their final semester as first years at Ayanagi Academy. However, with Itsuki Ootori expelled from the Kao Council, Team Ootori no longer qualifies as a Star Team. Stripped of their privileges, they also will not be allowed to participate in the upcoming graduation ceremony. Desperate to get their mentor back, Hoshitani and the others hatch a plan to convince the Kao Council to allow Ootori to reassume his former position.
