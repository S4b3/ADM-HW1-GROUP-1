animeDescription	"b'There are gamblers out there who even bet their lives as ante. But to secure the integrity of these life-threatening gambles, a violent and powerful organization by the name of ""Kagerou"" referees these games as a neutral party. Follow Bak Madarame a.k.a. Usogui (The Lie Eater) as he gambles against maniacal opponents at games\xe2\x80\x94such as Escape the Abandoned Building, Old Maid, and Hangman\xe2\x80\x94to ultimately ""out-gamble"" and control the neutral organization of Kagerou itself. \n\n(Source: MU) '"
