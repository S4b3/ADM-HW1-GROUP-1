animeDescription	"b'In the middle of an airborne heist, Lupin goes from stealing to stolen as he\'s carted off and forced to do a job for a mysterious man identifiable only by the brand of cigarette he smokes. Lupin\'s mission: to steal the infamous ""Bull\'s Eye"", a small green jewel best-known for the fact that everyone who\'s ever stolen it has ended up dead. Along with the challenge of alternately evading and pursuing a young thief with a competitive streak, Lupin and the gang must unravel the mystery of the Bull\'s Eye before its curse - or their mysterious taskmaster - gets the better of them. \n\n(Source: ANN)'"
