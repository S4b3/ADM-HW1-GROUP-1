animeDescription	"For this nonsensical animation,30 pictures per second were produced with only pencil tool.A man stretches out his arm and grasp the night view of a distant city NEW TOKYO. He and female companion rush down the length of his arm toward the city lights.The work is defined by a speedy style and comical pictures that express the sense of omnipotence derived from coming into a large sum of money and folly of letting happiness slip through your hands.

Short film by nuQ (Misaki Uwabo).
