animeDescription	"b""The shapeshifting Pok\xc3\xa9mon Zorua and Zoroark are captured by a mysterious group intent on using their illusory powers for their own gain. They unleash Zoroark on Crown City, forcing her beforehand to take the form of Suicune, Entei, and Raikou, the guardians of the town.\n\nAs Satoshi and his companions visit Crown City to watch the much-anticipated Pok\xc3\xa9mon Baccer World Cup, they encounter Zorua, who managed to escape captivity. At the same time, Zoroark goes on a rampage, unaware of Zorua's breakout. Disguised as the Legendary Beast Trio, she starts destroying the city and terrorizing its inhabitants.\n\nWill Satoshi manage to stop the deranged Pok\xc3\xa9mon before Crown City perishes? Will the sudden arrival of long-unseen Celebi change the outcome of the seemingly inevitable clash between Zoroark and the impersonated Legendary Beasts?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
