animeDescription	"This anime was made by Hudson Soft, which created the ""Star Soldier"" game. Its designer, Yoichi Takahashi, appeared in a cameo and sang the theme songs.

By coincidence, the film was released the same day as ""Super Mario Brothers,"" also based on a video game.

The film was a box-office failure in Japan.
