animeDescription	b'One day, an ordinal high school girl, Ma$%^&* (her name is left to your imagination), met Cheko, who was a maid came from a village of maids. She could melt, fly, and pull her head off... Anyway, strange people began to come, for example, a snow fairy who disliked cold, a large squid that could speak, scary persons, and the like. Pugyuru is a world of absurdity drawn by a hope of comedy. \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)'
