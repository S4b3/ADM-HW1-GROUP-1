animeDescription	A recap of the TV series. While two parts were made, only the first one was shown in theaters during the Uchuu Senkan Yamato Festival. The second part was released half a decade later direct to home-video by Nippon Columbia. Later releases on DVD in 1999 and 2002 put both halves of the recap together for sale.
