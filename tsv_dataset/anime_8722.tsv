A new competitive electronic sport called Circlet Bout emerges, and schools duel to determine the strongest Circlet Bout Club and player. One day, Yuuka Sasaki gets mistaken for a challenger and battles against Chikage Fujimura, the best player in Japan, tying the intense fight despite her inexperience.
