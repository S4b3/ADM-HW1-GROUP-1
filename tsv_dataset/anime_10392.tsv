animeDescription	"b'After a late-night conversation with her beloved brother, high school girl Arisa Minase wakes up the next day in a strange new land. She is greeted as ""Alice"" by twins known as Light and Shadow, who express their relief at Alice\'s return home. Arisa is insistent that she is not the Alice they speak of, but the strange characters of this world are adamant that she is.\n\nUpon meeting the kind and mysterious Black Rabbit, she learns that she is trapped in a place called Wonderland with no apparent escape. As she adjusts to her new reality, Arisa comes to find a whole host of peculiar creatures, such as the affectionate Cheshire Cat and the lazy dormouse Round.\n\nBut there is more to Wonderland than meets the eye. Each of the wild personalities she now shares a home with resembles someone she knew in her other life, yet not a single one of them recognizes their old name or relationships. Even stranger is the fact that time in Wonderland seems to never change, as every day is the same as the last. There appears to be no end to this cycle\xe2\x80\x94beyond whatever secrets the Black Rabbit is keeping.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
