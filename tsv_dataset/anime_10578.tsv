animeDescription	"b""Stuck on the desolate planet Walpurgis, two intrepid girls named Garnet and Crystal, along with their robotic bat Carrot, can only dispatch emergency broadcasts into space and hope that someone will eventually come to their rescue.\n\nIn an attempt to increase the distress signal's viewership ratings, Garnet and Crystal reformat the ordinary broadcast into a variety TV show to appeal to the masses. Having turned the entire planet into their stage, the two girls do what they can to get noticed, located, and rescued.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
