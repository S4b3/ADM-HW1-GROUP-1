animeDescription	"Typhoon Noruda director and Penguin Highway character designer Youjirou Arai created short anime movie for the Kagome juice brand's ""GO!ME."" project. The short is titled Natsu no Niwa (Summer Garden) and is the first independent anime produced by Arai's newly founded studio FILMONY.

The three-minute video features the song ""HEY HEY HO"" by ENJOY MUSIC CLUB featuring singer and songwriter Sachie Hiraga. The story takes place in a city turned upside-down after a girl named Mea discovers a stuffed animal with a strange power.

The GO!ME project sponsors ""youth who are going their own way."" The project's first video outlined some of its collaborations with dancers, musicians, tech innovators, and animators.
