B-Legend! Battle B-Daman Fire Spirits!	TV	51	2005-01-10 00:00:00	2005-12-26 00:00:00	4483	6.37	2262	6832	7325	"It is not uncommon to wish upon shooting stars. But for B-DaPlayers all around the world, what they seek is not for their wishes to be granted. Gazing upon what many would assume are just rocks shrunk to the size of a pebble by atmospheric entry and fallen to the earth, the fated ones see instead what are known as Strike Shotsâ€”powerful marbles originating from the vast and mystical outer space. 

After achieving triumph in the war against his ultimate foes, Yamato Daiwa continues his journey as a rising B-DaPlayer, looking to obtain a new power worthy of his improved battle gear.
