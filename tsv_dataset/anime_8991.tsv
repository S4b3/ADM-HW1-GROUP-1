animeDescription	"High schoolers Sayaka Takai and Akihiko Kannazuki work together at a restaurant chain ""Pia Carrot."" Both are interested in each other, but before either could make a move Sayaka was temporarily rotated to the newly established branch at a beach resort. While waitress girls at this new location did their best to confront harassment, make new friends, and attract new customers by attending a beauty contest, Sayaka's feeling for Akihiko never stops and has become stronger and stronger.
