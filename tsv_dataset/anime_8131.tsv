animeDescription	"A Hello Kitty claymation series.

The Stump Village itself is a group of tree stump houses located in a secluded area of a forest. The village residents are a tight-knit bunch: Badtz Maru, Cinnamoroll, My Melody, Pom Pom Purin, and Hello Kitty. The remaining Sanrio characters (of which there are literally hundreds) do not appear very much in this particular series.
