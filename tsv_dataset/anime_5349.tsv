animeDescription	"The Uraharajuku Boarders may have been knocked out of the Kantou Tournament, but a mysterious proposition from a mysterious man may influence the Governor, a graduate of Uraharajuku High School, to allow Uraharajuku to play Sena Kobayakawa and the Deimon Devilbats in the equally mysterious Golden Bowl, whose winner will seemingly receive a place in the Kantou Tournament. However, when Sena and company arrive at the field, they find the Golden Bowl may be something they didn't bargain for against opponents they may not be able to beat.
