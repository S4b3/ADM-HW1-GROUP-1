animeDescription	"b'Two years ago, the world was saved by Dan Bashin and the other light bearers of the cores. Having once risked his life in Grand Rolo\'s strife, Dan no longer finds passion in the mundanity of everyday card battles. When Dan desires to clash against stronger opponents, he is approached by Mai Shinomiya. She offers to bring him to the future, the stage of a new conflict where Dan\'s strength is needed.\n\nThe two arrive in the year 2650, where civilization has been ravaged by the struggle for power between mankind and an otherworldly race known as ""Mazoku."" As humanity begins to crumble under the dominance of the Mazoku, the hardened light bearers are destined to cross paths once more. Armed with new cards from the future, Dan and the other warriors must yet again bear the fate of humanity on their shoulders.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
