Those who are anointed with the ability to interact with these spirits are known as ""Shepherds."" Hailed as heroes for their prompt appearances in times of crisis, while also being feared for their power, the Shepherds are imprinted in common folklore along with the Seraphim.\n\nSorey is a young human who has spent his entire life living in harmony alongside the Seraphim in the village of Elysia. Fascinated by the myths of the Celestial Records, he explores some nearby ruins with Mikleo\xe2\x80\x94his childhood Seraphim companion\xe2\x80\x94hoping to enlighten himself about the Seraphims\' history with mankind.\n\nUnfortunately, they become trapped in the depths of the historical site during their investigation.
