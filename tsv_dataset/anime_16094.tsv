animeDescription	Commercials explaining the founder of Daido Seimei (Daido Life), an insurance company in Japan. Hirooka Asako (1849-1919) was an affluent woman who through persistence was able to push for insurance requirements of small to medium business enterprises for their employees as coal miners who were at the most risk/vulnerable if a disaster/injury were to happen. She did this by facilitating 3 large business enterprise insurance companies to break off small chunks to form 1 new company where all three had shareholder value.
