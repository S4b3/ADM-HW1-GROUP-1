is violated by a group of men under the effect of ""Aura of Ogre"", called ""Demi-Ogre"".
Although she had kept her virginity, the Demi-Ogres keeps sexually tormenting Yasuzu.
Now the only thing Yasuzu can think about is her senior kunoichi Botan who she has longed for.

There comes, however, the merchant carrying Yasuzu who has totally been screwed up.
