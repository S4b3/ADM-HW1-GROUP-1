But this soon comes to change when her grandfather requests the help of a humanoid robot named Q01.\n\nTaking on the appearance of Hal, Q01 is sent to Kurumi's house in order to save her from her state of despair. As Hal returns day after day and increases his efforts, Kurumi, despite her initial reluctance, slowly begins to open up to him and break free from her depression.
