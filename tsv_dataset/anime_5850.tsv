animeDescription	"b'Alcia is a world governed by ""Count"": numbers engraved on a person\'s body, representing any number related to their life. These Counts determine a person\'s social status and power in Alcia. If a Count reaches zero, the person is sent to the Abyss, a place rumored to be worse than death.\n\nHina, a traveler whose Count is based on the distance she traveled, witnessed her mother get dragged down into the Abyss. Determined to fulfill her mother\'s last wishes, she sets off on a journey in search of the legendary Aces\xe2\x80\x94heroes of the war that happened three hundred years ago, bearing a white star next to their Count.\n\nWhile wandering around, Hina encounters Licht Bach, a mysterious masked man with negative Count, and Nana, the owner of a tavern. In the midst of having a good time, Hina is tricked into a battle with a military soldier. However, despite his negative count, Licht rescues Hina and reveals that he has another count, one with a white star, one of a legendary Ace.\n\nPlunderer follows the journey of Hina and other inhabitants of Alcia as they discover the truth about their world, the Abyss, and the legendary Aces.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
