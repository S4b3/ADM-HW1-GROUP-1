She does this not only to teach Yadamon a lesson, but also because she has a secret passion for human magazines and books.  While at the human world, the queen keeps a close watch at Yadamon which becomes a problem cause she falls asleep almost anywhere.

The human world has gone extremely hi-tech.  Also, a lot of animals has become extinct.  Yadamon finds herself in the island named ''Creature Island'', where genetically re-created species are being made.  In the island she meets Jean and his parents Edward and Maria.
