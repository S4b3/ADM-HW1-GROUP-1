animeDescription	"b""In an alternate Azeroth, Thor and Loki have decidedly more Japanese names and face Ohera-san's (Hela) destructive wrath in what looks like ancient Japan. In reality, it's a silly short to promote the release of Thor: Ragnarok, titled Mighty Thor: Battle Royale in Japan. \n\n(Source: ANN)"""
