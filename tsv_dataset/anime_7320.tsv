The statues in question are the Sekkou Boys, or ""The Rockies,"" a boy band comprised of four Greco-Roman sculptures: St. George, Mars, Hermes, and Medici. These four busts are new to the entertainment scene, and it is up to Miki to ensure the Rockies' prosperity in the idol world. But will they be a stone-cold success? Or will Miki's management prove to be a rocky start to stardom?
