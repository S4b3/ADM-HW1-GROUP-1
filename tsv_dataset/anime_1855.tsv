But with so many incidents happening around them, could there be a larger mystery at work in their lives?\n\nSakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru is a story of two unlikely partners, each showing in their own way that bones can tell how one died, but only people can tell how they lived.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'
