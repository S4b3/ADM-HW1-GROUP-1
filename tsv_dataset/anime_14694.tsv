animeDescription	"It's been almost 100 years since the ""salaryman"" type of office worker first appeared in Japan back in the 1920s.

As our society faces a major turning point, SmartHR decided to create a brand film to reflect upon how work styles have changed with time over the past century.

We hope that by looking back on history, we inspire people to think about how they want to work going forward.
