animeDescription	b'Space Gundam V was presented as a Super Robot with quasi-mystical powers that battled a villainous entity on every episode. Much like the Super Robot shows Invincible Super Man Zambot 3 and Trider G7, the robot was piloted by a pre-teen boy. Notable villains included a giant rat and a winged devil.'
