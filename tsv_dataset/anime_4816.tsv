animeDescription	"b""After safely escorting the cowardly Takigakure leader Shibuki to his homeland, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno are taken aback by the village's sudden invasion of rogue ninjas. As their teacher Kakashi Hatake had departed for Konohagakure beforehand, the team is left to deal with the attacking forces on their own. \n\nWhile the group prepares for a rescue operation, they learn that Suien, the mastermind behind the assault, is pursuing the Hero Water\xe2\x80\x94an elixir that briefly increases the chakra of those who drink it by tenfold. Knowing that the liquid is in Shibuki's possession, Suien takes the villagers hostage to use them as a bargaining chip. \n\nDespite the odds stacked against them, Naruto fights the enemy heroically, spurring Shibuki on to discover the courage to protect his people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
