animeDescription	"b'A super deformed parody which depicts the ""making of "" Eternal Story and Destruction. A very humorous behind-the-scenes look (if ""Gall Force"" were a live-action series instead of being animated). \n\nCast and crew members run into severe and embarrassing difficulties as things do not turn out as they should; for example, Lufy totally drowns in embarrassment as she is object of a whole crowd of spectators while in the nude; the director\'s obsession with realistic filming causes some real high-voltage friction with Catty; and in the end, after the premiere, the girls end up in an ongoing on-stage tussle about which one is the most popular character.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)'"
