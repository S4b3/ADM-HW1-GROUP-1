animeDescription	"b""To Sora Kajiwara, the world is full of wonderful and adorable things she wants to draw\xe2\x80\x94cats being a popular object of her affection. Even though there are some things that can't be captured with a pencil and paper, she still brings her sketchbook wherever she goes. Her love of drawing eventually leads her to join her school's art club, despite her shy and childish personality.\n\nJust like herself, all of Sora's fellow art club members have their own vivid imagination and personality to match. Through her interactions with the rest of the club, Sora begins to break out of her shell and see more of the world around her, taking every opportunity to sketch whatever is on her mind or in her heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
