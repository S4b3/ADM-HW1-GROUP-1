In an attempt to save Egypt, Cleopatra, the younger sister of Ptolemy, chooses to undergo a procedure that makes her body irresistible to Caesar. Caesar is immediately smitten and desires to rule Egypt with Cleopatra at his side\xe2\x80\x94but little does he know that she intends to assassinate him as soon as she can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
