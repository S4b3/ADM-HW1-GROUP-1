animeDescription	"Surreal cutout (kiri-gami) animation following a young girl's physical journey, which is also an inner voyage through which she will learn all the pain and joy of life. She travels to an anonymous Western city, a bizarre dreamscape cluttered with elements from works by Dali, Magritte, de Chirico and Escher. The journey will change her completely but when she returns she will be the only one who knows how she has changed.
(The poem in the film is by Su Tong-Po, a famous Chinese poet)
