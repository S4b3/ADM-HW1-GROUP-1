animeDescription	"A collaboration series between Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo and the Japan Racing Association (JRA). 

The first two ads, ""Unknown Horse"" and ""Birth of Eva-Impact,"" begin with the Evangelion anime's Spear of Longinus falling from the heavens. Real-life jockey Yutaka Take, not being able to synchronize with an EVA unit weapon, tells Shinji, Rei and Asuka of the secret decision that has been made. ""Eva-Impact"" is an humanoid thoroughbred developed by JRA and Nerv as the ""Final Battle Weapon Type Horse."" Eva-Impact was born from the combination of Nerv technology and DNA extracted from legendary horses with a 150-year lineage. The fall of the Spear of Longinus triggered the development of this weapon.
