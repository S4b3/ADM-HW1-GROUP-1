Kaishain's TV broadcast it gets reborn with a brand new story and new characters (though some will make a come back). This time it follows the human Kamoyama who was on his way to becoming a corporate elite when 1 mistake sent him to work as the manager for the Sale Department Z filled with selfish (shellfish) incompetent employees. He aims to regain his corporate elitism by converting these clamployees into decent members of the workforce with good sales results. But their laziness knows no bounds.

The webisodes, which are being released on DLE's official YouTube channel, are slated to have official English subtitles."	['Asa Da yo! Kaishain']	[]	[]	[]	https://myanimelist.net/anime/40141/Deluxe_Da_yo_Kaishain
