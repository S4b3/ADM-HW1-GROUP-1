animeDescription	b'Kouichi Mizuki ends his high school basketball career on a high note, bringing his team to victory during their final match at nationals. Now free from club activities, he looks forward to spending more time socializing, maybe even finding room for romance. But fate has slightly different plans for him when a magical circle transports Kouichi to Tildant, the land of giants.\n\nUpon his arrival, Kouichi comes face-to-face with Caius Lao Bistail, the titan king and the culprit behind his summoning. Caius is overjoyed, claiming Kouichi to be his fated bride and asking him to bear his children! It soon becomes evident to Kouichi that his species, let alone gender, is not a problem as Caius pushes him down onto a lavish bed. Will Kouichi ever find romance in this relationship that is bound to end in tears?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nThe complete edition with explicit scenes was distributed online via Comic Festa Anime Zone.
