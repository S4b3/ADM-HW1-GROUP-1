animeDescription	"b'The 2008 animated omnibus Indie Anibox: Selma\'s Protein Coffee consists of three inventive short films from up-and-coming directors. Kim Woon Ki\'s kooky mystery thriller ""Wanted"" is set in a peaceful village suddenly disrupted by heavy rainfall and the appearance of a strange old woman named Selma. Yeon Sang Ho\'s 3-D animation ""Love is Protein"" is an inventive black comedy about three poor roommates who break their piggy banks to order fried chicken - only to discover their prospective meal is the son of a weeping chicken. Jang Hyung Yoon\'s surreal ""A Coffee Vending Machine and Its Sword"" follows a swordsman who reincarnates as a coffee vending machine and falls in love at first sight with the maintenance girl.\n\n(Source: YesAsia)'"
