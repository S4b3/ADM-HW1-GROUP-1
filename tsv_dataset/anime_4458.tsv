animeDescription	"b""Two years after Mizuho's graduation... Mikado Chihaya was truant at his school because of harassment in the school and of a distrust in men. His mother cannot bear to watch him be in trouble, so she makes him transfer to Seiou Girls' School, her old school. He dresses as a girl and introduces himself as Kisakinomiya Chihaya. Chihaya meets Nanahara Kaoruko, who once rescued him from a playboy, and he begins to live in the dormitory building. He becomes the focus of public attention due to his attractive face and figure, and due to high grades at studies.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"""
