However, even though she pretends they do not exist, she can still see how they disturb the people around her, especially her best friend, the energetic and lovely Hana Yurikawa. In order to protect them from the monsters\' annoyances, Miko gives it her best to continue her school life and avoid every troublesome crisis\xe2\x80\x94even when they scare her to tears. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
