Here, he entices an innocent girl who has trouble sleeping by taking away her bad dreams. He also ""seals the spell"" with a pinky promise and then later a kiss. In the end, ""when the full moon rises"" he steals her soul and takes her empty body to his ""monochrome world.""\n\n(Source: Vocaloid Wikia)'"
