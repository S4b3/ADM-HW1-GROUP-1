animeDescription	"Tamaki happens to find a sketchbook in her closet. Upon seeing the pictures within, she realizes that Roma has been with her in her memories. Meanwhile, the kickboxing club Roma belongs to is about to close because Roma is the only member and thus cannot take part in team tournaments. However, Roma isn`t concerned, and draws a nude picture of Misaki during his supplementary art class. When he beats up a stalker, the grateful Misaki begins to seduce him. On the other hand, Tamaki begins to be unsatisfied with their relationship as mere childhood friends.
