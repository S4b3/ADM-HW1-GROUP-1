Hoshi no Ko Poron	TV	260	1974-04-01 00:00:00	1975-04-04 00:00:00	460			16158	13163	"Poron/Polon is an alien child who comes in a flying saucer from the distant reaches of space to Earth. There, he soon encounters the native life-forms, although as a new arrival, he is unaware that he has ignored humans, and instead befriends a rabbit, a bear, and a fox. This little-known science fantasy is not to be confused with Chobin the Starchild, which started its TV run a month earlier.
