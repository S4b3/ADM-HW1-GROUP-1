animeDescription	"Still in pursuit of her ambitious goal, ingenious arms dealer Koko Hekmatyar, inexpressive child soldier Jonathan “Jonah” Mar, and the rest of their squad continue their mercenary activities. From professional assassins to private militaries, the group's work constantly puts them in the face of danger. 

But internal conflicts soon arise after Renato ""R"" Socci, one of Koko's bodyguards, is revealed to be an undercover agent for ""Operation Undershaft""—a plan devised by the CIA to infiltrate HCLI and exploit Koko as a tool. Shocked by his betrayal, Koko's leadership is needed now more than ever to rally her squad and rebuild their foundation of trust before they are torn apart.

Jormungand: Perfect Order follows Koko and the rest of her crew as they take on persistent adversaries, overcome internal struggles, and make Koko's vision of world peace a reality—where everything is in perfect order.
