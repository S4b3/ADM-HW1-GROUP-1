Naeil-eun Pyeongbeomhae Jilgeoya	Special	1	2008-06-20 00:00:00		200			12237	16025	"A special included on Indie Anibox: Selma Danbaekjil Coffee's DVD release. It was meant to be the ""making-of"" extra of Watashi no Coffee Samurai but is an early pilot with a different story (the idea of a mechanized girl and transforming guy vs. a mechanized transforming guy and normal girl). Director Jang Hyeong-yoon stewed on this early creation for over half a decade before the original idea was re-worked again into a feature film Ulibyeol Ilhowa Eollugso.

In the special, the girl is mechanized and fights kaijuu with her giant flying bird. The guy is a musician who confesses his feelings. When the girl runs away after his kiss (worried that her line of work may bring him danger if she reciprocated), he turns into a milk cow out of shock. They reconcile in the end.
