animeDescription	"b""Xie Lian and Hua Cheng recount their recent adventures during a quiet night at Puqi Shrine. Amidst the serenity, the Crimson Rain Sought Flower reveals a little more about Xie Lian's true character, and an embarrassing memory reminds him of how much he has changed since his previous ascensions. However, no matter how much time has passed, Xie Lian never fails to believe in the good he sees in the people around him. Though the heavens may ridicule him, his words and actions have earned him the most devout of followers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
