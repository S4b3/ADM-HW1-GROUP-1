Zou no Senaka: Tabidatsu Hi	OVA	1	2007-10-26 00:00:00		460	6.02	206	8580	13205	When elephants are about to die, they will leave their herd and die alone. When a person knows that he is about to die, what will he choose? It's lung cancer, and it has already metastasized. There are probably 6 months left. It's a story about a man's last few steps in his life. It's probably quite different from the elephants.	[]	[]	[]	[]	https://myanimelist.net/anime/27405/Zou_no_Senaka__Tabidatsu_Hi
