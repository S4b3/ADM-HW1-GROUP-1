animeDescription	"In Akihabara in the near future in 2037, the only income resource of the yakuza is electricity. Matsuyama, leader of the Kanto Cyber Imaginary Number Group, plans to light up a gigantic adult entertainment building with excess electricity in order to take over the land owned by the rival Nakahara-gumi. But its leader, Nakahara, has a reason to refuse it. His beloved Arika suffers from a rare disease where her body spasms to neon light - fatal if untreated.
