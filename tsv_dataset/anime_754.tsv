The former thief was murdered by a criminal organization seeking a mythical stone called the Pandora Gem, said to shed a tear with the passing of the Valley Comet that comes every ten thousand years. When the tear is consumed, the gem supposedly grants immortality.\n\nVowing to bring those responsible for his father\'s death to justice, Kaito dons the Phantom Thief\'s disguise, stealing priceless jewels night after night to find the Pandora Gem before his enemies can use the power for themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
