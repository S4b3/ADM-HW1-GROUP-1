animeDescription	"The time is set in the Mechatronics Era in the future. In this era, schools actually float in the Tokyo sky at around 2000 - 3000 metres. At home, there is freedom in movement as everyone has a flight mechanism within them which allows them to fly. Transportation is made easy as a result.
