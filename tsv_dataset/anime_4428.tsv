Makoto knows all of the ins and outs of the bustling Tokyo district and strives to maintain peace alongside the G-Boys, who assist Makoto in his troubleshooting endeavors. Led by the charismatic and ruthless Takashi Andou, the G-Boys is the most influential gang in all of Ikebukuro. \n\nHowever, when the new faction ""Red Angels"" begins to move in on the G-Boys\' turf, immediate tensions rise between them. With numerous enemies scattered around and within the G-Boys, navigating through the streets becomes more difficult for Makoto.
