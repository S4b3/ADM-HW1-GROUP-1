animeDescription	Twin City, as legend has it, is an evil city which was born at the time when Crystal City was created. There is a mirror-like lake above the city which has a horrifying power. It enables people to face the darkest side deep within their hearts. This darkness manifests as the person's opposite. The heroes must send these malicious beings back to their realm before they tear Crystal City apart.
