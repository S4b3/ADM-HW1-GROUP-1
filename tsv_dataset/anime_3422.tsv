animeDescription	b'Sho liked MTB very much and he always practiced at the practice field, \xe2\x80\x9cX-Zone\xe2\x80\x9d, with his friends, Takumi and Makoto. Takumi was a good mechanic and Makoto was a competitive girl rider. \n\nOne day, he was challenged by a MTB team, \xe2\x80\x9cShark Tooth\xe2\x80\x9d, of Samejima brothers\xe2\x80\x99 betting the X-Zone. For Sho, X-Zone was a memorable place where he had spent days with his dead father, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose the game. \n\nThe day came, and during the race with the leader of Shark Tooth, black smoke suddenly covered around, and they were sent to another world. When he came to, he found Kakeru, Makoto, and his MTB, \xe2\x80\x9cFlame Caesar\xe2\x80\x9d, were also there. \n\nWhile they were wondering what had happened, MTB riders came. \nThey challenged Sho to a MTB bout. They said Sho had to collect 10 pieces of emblems by winning MTB bout, \xe2\x80\x9cIdaten Battle\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nThis is how Sho came down to compete in Idaten Battle at various courses, such as, volcanos, ruins, deserts, snowy montains, and grave yards. \nWhether will show win the race to come back to his world? \n'
