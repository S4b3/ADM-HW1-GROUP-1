animeDescription	"b'The Kickers are first and foremost a football team. Actually, they\'re only playing for their school, but haven\'t exactly covered themselves with glory. When the new player, Gregor (Daichi Kakeru) arrives at the school, they just had faced a resounding defeat again. However, thanks to Gregor, things are going to change. Highly motivated, they\'ll try to get rid of their ""always-loser-team"" image. Their strongest enemy are the Devils, who Gregor provokes right from the start. However, it\'s not all about football. When the captain, Mario (Hongou Masaru), is not pursued by his female fans, the Kickers often hang around and do stuff together.\n(Source: AniDB)'"
