animeDescription	"b'Yuusuke was just a normal kid going to high school. Then one day, the cute and behaloed Noelle fell, quite literally, into his life, naked as a baby and every bit as innocent. Before he can even fathom what\'s just happened, Yuusuke is inducted into a rather odd family of otherworldly beings. \n\nPapa is a Frankenstein monster with a taste for calisthenics. Mama is a gorgeous lady with a penchant for ""round objects"" -- really! The eldest sister, Sara, is literally invisible; the brother, Gabriel, is a teenage vampire with an attitude problem; and the youngest sister, Ruka, loves inventing things. There\'s a disapproving Grandma, who\'s a witch to the nth degree, and her vulture familiar. All Yuusuke wanted was for the beautiful Natsumi to even notice his attention, but now he has an angel-in-training to follow him wherever he goes. And Noelle, too, has a guide on her path to being an angel, the mysterious Michael.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)'"
