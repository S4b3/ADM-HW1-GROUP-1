animeDescription	"He wears a bowl on his head and dances to the rhythms of Samba! What in the world is this creature? It is Owanco! He is a fairy dog who wears a bowl like a hat.
He loves food so much that he transforms himself into whatever food he pleases. His biggest fan and the admirer of tea-cupped-poodle, ""Pooko-chan"" and his rival cat, ""Nori-Tama"" (Nori=seaweed, Tama=the most typical name for cats in Japan) will join the fun ride.
By the way, what's for dinner tonight?
