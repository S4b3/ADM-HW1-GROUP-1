animeDescription	b'Long ago there was a war in Heaven which resulted in Judas and Luca \xe2\x80\x93 two of the six specially-chosen, talented and strong Saint Beasts \xe2\x80\x93 being cast out and imprisoned in Hell for leading the rebellion. But before that Heaven had been a peaceful place where the angels happily lived their lives. In this time, Judas, Luca, Goh, Shin, Rey and Gai are adolescent angels in Heaven who, on the day of Benediction, are made into adults by the supreme god Zeus. With each of the six having their own special abilities and new adult bodies to get used to, opportunities to meet each other arise and new friendships are formed. \n\n(Source: Anivide)'
