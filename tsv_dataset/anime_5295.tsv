animeDescription	"U.C. 0083 - Three years after the end of the catastrophic One Year War, peace on Earth and the colonies is shattered by the presence of the Delaz Fleet, a rogue Zeon military group loyal to the ideals of the late dictator Gihren Zabi. Delaz Fleet`s ace pilot Anavel Gato, once hailed as ""The Nightmare of Solomon"", infiltrates the Federation`s Torrington base in Australia and steals the nuclear-armed Gundam GP02A ""Physalis"" prototype. Rookie pilot Kou Uraki - with the aid of Anaheim Electronics engineer Nina Purpleton and the crew of the carrier Albion - pilots the Gundam GP01 ""Zephyranthes"" prototype in an attempt to recover the stolen Gundam unit and prevent another war from breaking out.
