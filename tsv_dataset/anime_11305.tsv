animeDescription	"b""The sun rises in one place and the sun sets in another.\nWhen a woman's hair grows up, a man shaves off her elongated beard.\nEven if the time is different, the time passes in the same way anywhere.\nThe earth turns and the sun rises again.\n\nEach of the frames has a structure that loops indefinitely.\n\n(Source: Official website)"""
