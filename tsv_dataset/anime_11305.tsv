animeDescription	"The sun rises in one place and the sun sets in another.
When a woman's hair grows up, a man shaves off her elongated beard.
Even if the time is different, the time passes in the same way anywhere.
The earth turns and the sun rises again.

Each of the frames has a structure that loops indefinitely.
