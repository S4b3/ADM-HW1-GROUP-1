animeDescription	"During the day, the Egyptian gods take their jobs very seriously. However, in their spare time, the deities enjoy themselves as much as they can by partaking in a wide range of activities. Toutotsu ni Egypt Shin gives insight into the energetic lives of the gods and the sudden chaos they find themselves in on a daily basis.
