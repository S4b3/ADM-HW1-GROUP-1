In the year 3394, Nagate Tanikaze surfaces from his lifelong seclusion deep beneath the seed ship Sidonia in search of food on the upper levels, only to find himself dragged into events unfolding without his knowledge.\n\nWhen the Gauna begin their assault on Sidonia, it's up to Tanikaze\xe2\x80\x94with the help of his fellow soldiers and friends Shizuka Hoshijiro, Izana Shinatose, and Yuhata Midorikawa\xe2\x80\x94to defend humanity's last hope for survival, and defeat their alien foes.
