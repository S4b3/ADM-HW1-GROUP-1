animeDescription	"In a fictional school, ""Tender Tank"" Rareko is constantly opening absurd yet strangely enthusiastic debates, this way creating a lively classroom life. Bringing up tremendous themes, she and her classmates exchange words like sword-strokes, and here and there even a profound remark is slipped in. 

A fun and informative debate comedy, packed into only five minutes each time.
