animeDescription	b'Akira Tachibana, a reserved high school student and former track runner, has not been able to race the same as she used to since she experienced a severe foot injury. And although she is regarded as attractive by her classmates, she is not interested in the boys around school.\n\nWhile working part-time at the Garden Cafe, Akira begins to develop feelings for the manager\xe2\x80\x94a 45-year-old man named Masami Kondou\xe2\x80\x94despite the large age gap. Kondou shows genuine concern and kindness toward the customers of his restaurant, which, while viewed by others as soft or weak, draws Akira to him. Spending time together at the restaurant, they grow closer, which only strengthens her feelings. Weighed down by these uncertain emotions, Akira finally resolves to confess, but what will be the result?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'
