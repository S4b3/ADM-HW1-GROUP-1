animeDescription	b'Our protagonist Tatsuya was living a normal life as a video game fanatic and altogether average guy. One day he stumbled upon a dark-skinned beauty being attacked by dogs in an alleyway... One thing leads to another and she ended up living with him as she had nowhere else to go...\n\nWith nothing of her own, she can only think of one way to thank him for his kindness...\n\n(Source: Hanime)'
