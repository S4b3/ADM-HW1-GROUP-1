Beck, a legendary hunter with the power of ""Red Ash,"" aims to undergo the surgical procedure to become Purerace. Alongside the large yet timid mechanic Tyger, they use their parallel machine to fly to the old world, doing dangerous jobs.\n\nOne day, they suddenly run into Call, a girl pursued by the duo of Safari and Stripe.
