animeDescription	b'The only thing that concerns Coji Coji is enjoying life and the wonders of nature. Coji Coji\xe2\x80\x99s friends, on the other hand, are a varied bunch of colorful characters whose many idiosyncrasies have a tendency to create turmoil among one another. Coji Coji\xe2\x80\x99s carefree ways and tendency to shirk responsibility are sometimes a source of frustration, but his childlike wisdom has a way of resolving all of their differences.\n\n(Source: AniDB)'
