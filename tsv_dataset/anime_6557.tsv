Galo Sengen	Music	1	2011-01-09 00:00:00		1520	6.42	929	6557	10156	"Galo Sengen (""Galish Man GAL"" in English / GAL男宣言 in Japanese) is a 2011 rap music video by the Japanese hip-hop group Policeman.

The animated music video became well-known for its humorous depiction of a Japanese youth culture known as ""Gyaruo,"" which is characterized by the dark tanned skin, dyed blond hair and appreciation for dance music. 

In the video, a group of men are satirically portrayed as Super Saiyans, a type of superfighters from the Japanese manga franchise Dragon Ball, who transcend into the state of ""galish"" or ""gyaru,"" a slang term derived from the Japanese pronunciation of English word ""girl.""
