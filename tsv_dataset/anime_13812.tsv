animeDescription	"The Planet of Stray Cats, the ""grown-up"" CG gag comedy anime from studio Plus Heads collaboration with the ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" film. The film's director George Miller himself approved this collaborative short.  The anime features the nonsensical, surreal conversations of stray cats on a planet. The only voice cast member, named Monica, ad-libs the dialogue of all the characters."
