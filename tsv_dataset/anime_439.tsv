animeDescription	"b""At a remote hot springs lodge, Yona and the team rest. The boys are taking a bath with the exception of Ki-ja, who looks troubled. Jae-ha takes this chance to tease him, unwittingly finding a mark linked to the previous White Dragon\xe2\x80\x94whom coincidentally is also Ki-ja's father\xe2\x80\x94prompting Ki-ja to recall their complicated relationship.\n\nIn another time and place, Son Hak and the dragons banter as they hold a drinking contest. As they start to doze off one-by-one, Zeno dreams of his past, where his abilities and experiences, both as a person and as the Yellow Dragon, are revealed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
