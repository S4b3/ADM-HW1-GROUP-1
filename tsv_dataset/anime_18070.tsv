animeDescription	"Based on the game by Active. 

The hit series Discipline is revived with this new original story set prior to the coming of Hayami Takuro, protagonist of the first series.

Morimoto Leona and Otokawa Saori are newly arrived boarding students at St. Alcadia Academy. Morimoto Leona desires to subjugate every person within the school, severely punishing those who are of no use to her. Even the teachers are not spared. Fellow boarders Yuuki, Ruri and Maiko, who are oblivious of the situation, fall prey to the limitless sexual desires of the male students."
