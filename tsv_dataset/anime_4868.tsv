animeDescription	"A man who appears every 700 years.
Streaching before the man's eyes the world rusted away to monochrome and gray.
Once before the town flourished that is now in ruins.
The man now, has a chance meeting with a person, a prositute.
A story of passion curling like smoke....Tairosu Tomah's story has begun.
