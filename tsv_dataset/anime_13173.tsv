And if you had the chance to change your life, would you?\n\nThere are two worlds that exist: reality; and a world that you think is reality. Da Wei is a young man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about anyone or anything aside from himself. However, when he finds out that his entire world is nothing more than an illusion and what\xe2\x80\x99s more, it\xe2\x80\x99s on the brink of collapse, will he make the decision to involve himself for the first time in something for the sake of others?\n\n(Source: Baka-Updates Manga)'
