animeDescription	"Centers around the unprofitable artist Sam, the unprofitable playwright Borman, and their friend Greg. The one thing they all have in common is that they are poor. The three decide to enter a contest to earn money â€” but since they cannot afford to mail their entries, they decide to take the long trip to the competition site to bring their entries in person.
