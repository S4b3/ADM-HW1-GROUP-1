animeDescription	"b'The final plans to finish Shell off in court have been made by Easter, Balot, and Oeufcoque. But in order to execute those plans, they must set foot into Shell\'s domain: the BlueEgg Casino in the center of Mardock City, and find the chip where his memories lie. If they can\'t find the chip, their case will be dismissed in court, and their ""usefulness"" will be gone \xe2\x80\x93 resulting in all of their deaths. Will Balot find the chip in time, while still dodging Boiled and his now mad search for her and Oeufcoque?\n\n(Source: the witch of theatregoing)'"
