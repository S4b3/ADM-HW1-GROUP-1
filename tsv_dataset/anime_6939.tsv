animeDescription	"b""During the closing days of the Gryps conflict of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, two siblings\xe2\x80\x94Asagi and Takuya\xe2\x80\x94ride aboard a civilian transport bound for Earth. Caught in a battle between the Titans and AEUG, they must somehow guide their ship through atmospheric entry. Luckily, they're not completely alone, as they find aid from a custom-painted Zeta Gundam, whose pilot sounds a lot like One Year War ace Amuro Ray.\n\n(Source: ANN)"""
