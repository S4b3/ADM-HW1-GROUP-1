However, after Baki\'s friend, Retsu Kaiou, brings him to China, he learns about the centurial Raitai Tournament, where the fiercest warriors fight to be crowned as the strongest martial artist in all of China. \n\nAs it is now allowing entry to foreigners, Baki is informed that he will have to compete in the tournament as it holds the cure to his illness.
