animeDescription	"Namakura Gatana, meaning ""dull-edged sword,"" is a two-minute comedy about a samurai who, thanks to his dull instrument, loses every time he attacks a weak opponent. In order to examine the sword, he tries to attack passers-by, but lower-class townspeople fight back and knock him down.
