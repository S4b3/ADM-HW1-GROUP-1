animeDescription	"Red Shadow, created by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, is a ninja who wears a red-and-black costume and a stylized red mask. His adventures take place in Feudal Japan, and he and his ninja sidekicks Aokage and Shirokage fight evil warlords, wizards and daikaiju using modern high-tech gadgetry (a blatant oddity in a period setting).
