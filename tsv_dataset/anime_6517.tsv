animeDescription	"There are two sides to every love story, and Boys Be... reveals what's really going onâ€”from the guy's point of view!

Meet three normal high school guys with just one thing on their minds: girls. Quiet Kyoichi has been friends with Chiharu ever since they were young, but lately, his feelings have begun to change. Lecherous Makoto, a self-proclaimed master of the rules of romance, is ready to sweep the ladies off their feet. And Yoshihiko, a handsome sports nut, is unfortunately a bit clueless in matters of the heart.

Join this hapless trio for a year of romantic misadventures that will change their lives forever!
