Naniwabushi Daisuki	Special	1	1982-02-07 00:00:00		202			12285	16026	"Two stories that mix animation with naniwabushi (storytelling accompanied by shamisen playing). One is a tale of General Nogi, the famous suicide, visiting the shrines at lse on his way to Nagoya, while his wife is mistaken for a commoner as she books into a hotel.

The second story is of a sumo wrestling trainee, ridiculed by his fellows, who trains hard and avenges himself-the standard cliches of a sports anime, just with plink-plonky music on top of it.
