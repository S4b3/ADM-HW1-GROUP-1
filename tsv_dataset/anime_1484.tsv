animeDescription	"This story is about a girl, Candy, who is an orphan. She is a nice and optimistic girl and she has a warm heart. When she was a child, she lived in an orphanage called Pony's Home. She had a good friend called Annie. And she met the ""Prince of the Hill"" who is a important person in her life, on the hill behind the orphanage.

She was adopted by the Leagan's family. What's awaiting her are the bad-hearted Neil and his sister, Eliza. One day, in the rose garden, she met a boy, who is identical to the ""Prince of the Hill"" who she had met in her childhood. The boy is called Anthony.
