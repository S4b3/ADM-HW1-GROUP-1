animeDescription	"b""While working as an informant for the Venetian government, Casius travels to the grand and lustrous city of Constanivole to meet his longtime friend Falco. As he is giving him a tour of the city, Falco suggests they visit the slave market: a place where captured women are sold at exorbitant prices to wealthy bureaucrats. Casius is initially hesitant to take part in the debauchery, but eventually has a change of heart and buys the girls in order to protect them. Unbeknownst to him, the girls he purchased will soon send him headfirst into a series of tumultuous events.\n\nDorei Ichiba follows Casius as he spends his days in the foreign city with his three slaves\xe2\x80\x94Bianca, a childish woman who calls him 'big brother'; Cecilia, a peasant who ran away from her abusive, blue-blooded fiance; and Myia, a mute girl with dark secrets. As he uncovers their tragic stories while making love to them, he finds himself slowly succumbing to a carnal desire that threatens to change him for good.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
