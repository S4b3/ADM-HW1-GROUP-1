animeDescription	"b""In the 3rd series continues as the gang hits up a karaoke bar at night only to cause a ruckus with their less than desirable signing. They soon find out the karaoke bar might close from local hooligans and attempt to rescue it for compensation. A fellow gang member gets involved too deep with a woman--even though he's married."""
