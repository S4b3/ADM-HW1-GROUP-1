animeDescription	"b'In the year 2010, practically one hundred percent of Cat Earth\'s GDP comes from the megacorporation Catty & Co., which is rapidly spreading across the rest of the galaxy. Here lives Tamala, a beautiful yet foul-mouthed cat, who decides to travel to the planet of her birth, Orion. After an unfortunate crash landing on the planet Q, Tamala meets Michaelangelo, a fellow cat, whom Tamala refers to as ""MoiMoi.""\n\nAs Tamala and Michaelangelo explore the planet\'s capital, Hate City\xe2\x80\x94which is under martial law to separate the feuding cat and dog populations\xe2\x80\x94they pass by graffiti and museum exhibits about the ancient cult of Minerva that speak of something dark and sinister. After Tamala catches the eye of the extremely violent motorcycle-riding Kentauros, she and Michaelangelo flee, but mysteries about Tamala\'s identity continue to surface. Why did Tamala originally leave Orion, and what exactly is her connection to Catty & Co.?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
