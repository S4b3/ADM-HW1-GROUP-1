animeDescription	"These three specials came with the DVD release. They mostly depict stories that take place in-between episodes from the main series.

Special #1 takes place in-between episodes 2 and 3.

Special #2 takes place in-between episodes 3 and 4.

Special #3 doesn't fit very well in-between any of the main series, and is more of a side-story."
