animeDescription	"Two years ago, Glory started out as just another MMORPG, but its real-world influence has grown as more countries begin to recognize esports as an official sport. Now, in China, arrangements are being made to hold the first professional league of Glory, culminating in the Glory Championship.

Friends Ye Qiu and Su Muqiu both aspire to make a career out of esports. However, due to personal reasons, Ye Qiu has been hesitant until now to chase his dream onto the national stage. When the two boys finally agree to form their own team, they are supported by Tao Xuan, their boss and the owner of Excellent Era internet cafe, after which they name their team. And so, Team Excellent Era sets their sights on defeating all opponents who stand in their way of reaching the ultimate summit of Glory.
