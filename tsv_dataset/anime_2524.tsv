animeDescription	"b""Hinata Hoshino, Hana Shirosaki, and Noa Himesaka are off to the countryside for a camping trip. At Hinata's behest, her elder sister, Miyako, reluctantly tags along. Seeing how gloomy Miyako is, the trio do their best to get her to enjoy herself too.\n\nBesides the camping trip, Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! Special contains three more short stories of the girls. Although their lives seem normal, one thing is certain: there is definitely no shortage of cuteness here!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
