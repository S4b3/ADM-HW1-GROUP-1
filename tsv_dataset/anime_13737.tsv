animeDescription	"Six recap episodes of Tatakae! Chou Robot Seimeitai Transformers Victory released straight to home-video after the main anime finished airing on national Japanese TV. Sometimes they are are labeled as episode 39-44. 

The first of these recaps was not included on Pioneer's DVD re-release in 2003 but the others are. The final ep of these recaps also uses footage from Transformers Headmasters and Transformers: Choujin Master Force into the narrative, most of which are repurposed as new events occurring concurrently with the story line.
