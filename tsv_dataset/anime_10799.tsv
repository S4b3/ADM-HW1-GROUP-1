animeDescription	"Three 10-minute videos present a trippy view into the minds of their creators. Brought together by Pierre Taki of Denki Groove, Mechano: Scientific Attack Force features three shorts done in very different styles.

The three short films are:

""Plastic Gun Man"" - a 3D Western spoof
""World Meccano Triangle"" - a music video reminiscent of '90s era screensavers
""Haiirogaoka no Soridaijin"" (translated as ""Prime Minister of Gray Hill"") - an anime-style animated video parody of Akira Mochizuki's famous 1977 manga, Yuuhi ga Oka no Souri Daijin"
