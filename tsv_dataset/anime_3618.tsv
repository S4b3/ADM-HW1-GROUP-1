With the addition of exciting new features such as missions and story events, the GBN experience is more immersive than ever before. Amidst the player base, a user known as Hiroto Kuga has been gaining notoriety for his top-notch skills.

Through a series of coincidences, Hiroto meets three other players: the boastful Kazami Torimachi, the mysterious May, and the timid Parviz. Forming the ""BUILD DiVERS,"" the unlikely group sets on a story mission rumored to carry bountiful in-game rewards. Together, the BUILD DiVERS must confront their own weaknesses as they join arms in a journey that may very well transcend the existence of GBN itself.
