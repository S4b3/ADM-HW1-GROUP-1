Crayon Shin-chan Manatsu no Yoru ni Ora Sanjou! Arashi wo Yobu Den-O vs. Shin-O 60-bu Special!!	Special	1	2007-08-03 00:00:00		1981	6.45	856	6408	9460	"A sixty minute special of the Crayon Shin-chan anime featuring a crossover between Shin-chan and the live action tokusatsu series Kamen Rider Den-O, as well as three normal summer-themed episodes. The Den-O characters are drawn in the style of Shin-chan's regular characters. 

Another thing of note, inbetween commercial breaks, clips of a live action Shin-Chan onboard the Den-Liner or with characters from the Kamen Rider Den-O Series were shown. In most of these scenes it involves the Owner giving Shin a speech of sorts or making Shin feel uncomfortable.
