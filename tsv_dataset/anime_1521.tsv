animeDescription	"What does it mean to become an adult? While it may seem like it brings freedom, the transition into adulthood can also create a gap between loved ones. For the teenagers who once laughed together, work, distance, and responsibilities widen the rift between them. Reminiscence reminds them of the joy-filled times when they were more carefree, and even now, through thick and thin, their love perseveres.
