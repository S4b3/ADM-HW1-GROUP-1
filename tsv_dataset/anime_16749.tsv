animeDescription	Music video for the song Kin no Makiba by Taeko Oonuki that was featured on NHK's Minna no Uta program. The video was animated by Osamu Sakai. A shorter version of the work was originally made by Mr. Sakai for his graduation film in 2001, which he redrew for the program. In 2004, Taeko Oonuki and Osamu Sakai again collaborated to release a picture book inspired by the work, which included a DVD with the Minna no Uta version.
