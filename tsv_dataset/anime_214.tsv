animeDescription	"Day 2539: Rin wakes up alone again with blurred memories and still no contact from any other human. She's not bored, however, because in her arms lies a tablet capable of creating any world her heart desires. Day after day, Rin crafts a wonderful reality—one utopia at a time—to shelter her from loneliness, hoping to one day reveal the truth behind her very existence.
