animeDescription	"Usavich (ウサビッチ) (from Japanese うさぎ ""usagi"", rabbit, with ""vich"" giving it faux Russian flavor) is a series of animated short films being produced for MTV Japan by Kanaban Graphics. It's about an odd couple of rabbits imprisoned in a Russian prison. While the first season (1-13 eps) shows the absurd everyday occurrences of the two rabbits' prison life, the second season (14-26 eps) tells the adventures of their escape and life on the run.
