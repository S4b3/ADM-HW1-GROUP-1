She dies on the operating table leaving both father and son heartbroken even more (as Annie's mother herself died sometime between this special and the last special).

They slowly heal alongside magpies and Kkachi's father remarries again after he's released from prison, this time to Kkachi's female mentor who helped him overcome his depression.
