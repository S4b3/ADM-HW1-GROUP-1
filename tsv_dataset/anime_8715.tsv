animeDescription	"b'Mari is a young elementary schooler who is terrified of two things\xe2\x80\x94eating vegetables and crossing ""Fear\'a Bridge""\xe2\x80\x94so much so that she has recurring nightmares of being forced to confront her fears. She avoids eating vegetables at all costs, and wakes up early so she and her friend Momo can walk out of their way to avoid the bridge.\n\nOne day, Momo gets a dog that can\'t be walked on the busy road she and Mari usually take, and Momo walks across the bridge, leaving Mari to walk to school alone. That same day, Mari\'s teacher sets a goal for the class to stop leaving food on their plates at lunchtime and Mari has to eat all three of her least favorite foods: carrots, peppers, and milk. After passing out from the shock of eating the vegetables, she awakens in the nurse\'s office to three food spirits calling themselves Ninninman, Piiman, and Milk. With the help of these bizarre beings, can Mari overcome her fears?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n'"
