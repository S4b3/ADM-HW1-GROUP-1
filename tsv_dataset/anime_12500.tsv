animeDescription	"The anime centers on a Moai statue named Mowai-kun who is gloomy every day because it lives a dull life where it just watches the beach and the sun from atop a hill on an island. But one day Mowai-kun grows arms, and starts to dance. The anime will air within the Oha-Suta program's ""Kyara-Suta"" corner.
