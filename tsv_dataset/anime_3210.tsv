animeDescription	"These specials feature the Oshitari cousins in a Manzai (漫才) setup [a style of stand-up comedy in Japan, which usually involves two performers—a straight man (tsukkomi) and a funny man (boke)].

Story 1 involves Oshitari Yuuhi who is tired of being the tsukkomi and wants to try his hand at being a boke but with disastrous results.

Story 2 is about Oshitari Kenya in the role of a boke whose jokes didn't get through to the audience in a joint Namiwa-Seishun Talentshow."
