The golden ball then turns into the TOHO Cinemas logo as Luffy holds it out to the viewer.

Eiichiro Oda himself supervised the collaboration to give the most manga-art accurate imagery possible."	['One Piece Film: Gold', 'One Piece Film: Gold - Cine Mike Popcorn Kokuchi']	[]	[]	[]	https://myanimelist.net/anime/36242/TOHO_Cinemas_x_One_Piece_Film__Gold_-_Tokubetsu_Eizou
