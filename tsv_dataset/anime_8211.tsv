animeDescription	"A collaboration between One Piece Film: Gold and TOHO Cinemas. It features the One Piece cast in a manga sakuga style batting around ball which then becomes gold colored with the cast gaining their colored anime film's design too. The golden ball then turns into the TOHO Cinemas logo as Luffy holds it out to the viewer.

Eiichiro Oda himself supervised the collaboration to give the most manga-art accurate imagery possible."
