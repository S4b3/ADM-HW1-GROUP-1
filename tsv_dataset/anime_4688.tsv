The boys of the Arcana Famiglia are tricked into taking the potion and find themselves in bodies that are not their own. With this successful experiment, Jolly has paved the way for a plethora of uncomfortable scenarios. However, despite the boys' desperate struggle to switch themselves back, there is something to be learned from spending the day in someone else's shoes.
