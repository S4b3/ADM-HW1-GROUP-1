As president and vice president of the student council, as well as a couple, Reiko and Shintaro are given the jobs of keeping tabs on the preparation together. While browsing through campus, they find a fellow student who request they sample the drink he was making for the festival. Suddenly, not knowing why, Reiko starts feeling aroused and decides to take Shintaro into a classroom set up as a dark maze.
