animeDescription	"b""Miss Black General is the villainous leader of RX, a secret organization bent on world-domination. Unfortunately, Miss Black General also has a huge crush on Brave Man, a costumed superhero dedicated to foiling RX's evil schemes, and she often mistakes his violent heroics for an overly enthusiastic form of flirtation. So how exactly is she going to to conquer the world when she can't even conquer her own feelings? And how will Brave Man respond to this odd twist?\n\n(Source: HoboP)"""
