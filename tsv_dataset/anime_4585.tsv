animeDescription	"b'In the fourth movie, the classical Japan-Europe match becomes intercontinental. This time they arrange a world cup with 4 teams: Japan, USA, ""All Europe"", and ""All South America"". In the first match, Japan easily defeats the USA 3:0 and in the second match Europe loses 2:3 against South America. In the final round S.A. shows their ""soccer cyborg"" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable. All their classical tricks like Hyugas ""Tiger Shot"" or Tsubasas ""Top Spin"" seem to be totally worthless, but in a hard and spectacular match the Japanese learn more and more to play in unison and finally they get the win.\n\n(Source: ANN)'"
