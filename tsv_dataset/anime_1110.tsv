animeDescription	"In the future, advanced robotics has created heavy robots (""labors"") for use in a variety of functions: construction, fire-fighting, military, and more. However, though the robots are only machines, their operators are also only humanâ€”and humans sometimes turn to crime. Since a heavy labor unit can be a dangerous weapon, the police of the future are set to fight fire with fire, using advanced patrol labor units, ""patlabors."" This is the story of the Second Special Vehicles Division, a motley crew of patlabor policemen and women doing their best to fight crime and live a normal life.
