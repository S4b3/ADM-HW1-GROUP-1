animeDescription	"In the new series, Miraitchi and Kururutchi, twin sisters who dream of becoming designers, travel from the future back in time to modern-day Dream Town. (Their names are a wordplay on the Japanese words for ""future"" and ""miracle."")

To get back to the future, they must collect all eight Dreambakutchi â€” mysterious Tamagotchi who have escaped throughout the town.
Mametchi joins Miraitchi and Kururutchi on their mission to find the Dreambakutchi, but then, an enigmatic Tamagotchi named X-Kamen (X-Mask) appears.
