animeDescription	"b'A Cinderella story of sorts, Fashion Lala stars a little girl named Miho who doesn\'t get along with her family. Miho loves to design clothing, but her aunt and three cousins don\'t believe that such a young girl is capable and mock her designs. Meanwhile, a contest for the new ""Disco Queen"" is coming up, and Miho wants nothing more than to be able to design a dress for someone to wear to the competition, since she\'s too young to enter herself. With determination and a little bit of magic, Miho\'s dreams just might come true!'"
