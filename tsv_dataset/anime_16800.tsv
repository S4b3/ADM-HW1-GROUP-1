animeDescription	"It all starts when Duri lost his favorite sport car “Ace”. As Duri accidentally drops Ace on the road while he’s running, Rubby found Ace on the road while he was cleaning the street. Rubby thought it was garbage, so threw Ace away on the garbage dumb. So as Hana, Duri and Tayo rushed and went to find Ace, he was already taken away to the Land of Toys! Toy Land is where old and abandoned toys come to live together without humans! (Only lucky toys though!) Will Duri be able to find Ace and bring him back? It will be a fun but a long adventure, so come with us!
