animeDescription	"One night a Goblin father came home gave his son a red handball.
But the boy was shocked to hear that his father picked it up in front of the house of a girl called Yuki
The boy decided to return it to her.
Next morning, he ran in the snow to a village and saw many boys and girls  singing cheerfully.
When he came to a small house, he saw a girl sitting alone on the veranda.
She said, ""I am Yuki. Who are you?"" 
He handed a ball to her without an answer.
She was very glad and said "" I was looking for it. My sickly mother made this for me. 
Thank you very much."" 
That gave him relief and they become friends.
