animeDescription	"b'For the 73rd class of cadets of the Defense University of the small planet Kibi, a shakedown cruise on the fleet\'s new starship ""Amaterasu"" is a fitting lead-up to graduation. As they are returning to their home planet, however, they are shocked to hear news of a declaration of war by the aggressive Kingdom against Kibi. When their planetary government surrenders without a struggle, the cadets decide to launch their own war, aboard the ""Amaterasu"". To gain funding, they make a deal with a galactic news network - and find themselves the ""stars"" of their own ""reality show"". Unfortunately, this is the kind of reality show that can get you killed... \n\n(Source: ANN)'"
