animeDescription	"b'""The Bandai Channel website announced that Petit Eva ~Evangelion@School~, the ""first official super-deformed series"" based on Neon Genesis Evangelion, will be adapted for video. The official announcement will be made in the September issue (on sale August 10) of Newtype magazine in Japan. The Gainax/Khara franchise spinoff spoofs the psychological science fiction drama by reimagining the characters as classmates in Tokyo-3\'s Nerv School, headed by Principal Gend\xc5\x8d Ikari and Misato-sensei. The student body includes three different Rei ""sisters,"" the EVA-01 mobile weapon reimagined as the school bully Evanch\xc5\x8d, and the ill-fated Jet Alone robot as JA-ko, a ""hidden character"" in the form of a shy android girl. \n\nRyuusuke Hamamoto created the character designs which has inspired four-panel gag manga serializations in four different magazines: Monthly Sh\xc5\x8dnen Ace, Newtype, Dengeki Hobby Magazine, and Figure Oh. The Petit Eva project has also developed merchandising from super-deformed figurines to limited edition Doritos corn chips.""\n\n(Source: MoonPhase)'"
