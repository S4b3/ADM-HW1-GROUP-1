animeDescription	"b'Yuki Kano has it all: fame, wealth, the world at her feet. There\'s also something very wrong with her... from time to time, she\'s totally unable to sing (which, for a pop star, is not good). Enter Bosujima, a ""psycho diver"" with the capability to enter people\'s heads and straighten out what\'s wrong with them. Well, most of the time, anyway.\n\n(Source: ANN)'"
