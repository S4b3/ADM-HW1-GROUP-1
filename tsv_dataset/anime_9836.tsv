Psycho Diver: Mashou Bosatsu	OVA	1	1997-05-21 00:00:00		4520	5.67	1604	9836	7302	"Yuki Kano has it all: fame, wealth, the world at her feet. There's also something very wrong with her... from time to time, she's totally unable to sing (which, for a pop star, is not good). Enter Bosujima, a ""psycho diver"" with the capability to enter people's heads and straighten out what's wrong with them. Well, most of the time, anyway.
