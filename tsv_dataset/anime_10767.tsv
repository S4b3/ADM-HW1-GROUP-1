animeDescription	"The fourth and final OVA of the Leina-centric Machine Robo: Revenge of Chronos spin-off/sequel. Instead of following the story of the previous Wolf Sword Legend continuity, Lightning Trap takes place in another universe.

In present day Tokyo, traveling has never been more comfortable than aboard the Lightning L808, Japan's new luxury passenger plane. One day, on what seemed to be a routine flight, Haruka Leina and the plane's passengers were unaware of the mysterious and top secret cargo brought aboard, which attracted the attention of international terrorists set on obtaining it. Now, with a dangerous hostage situation at hand, only special agent Laika Strange and brave Leina may be able to save the passengers, and keep the deadly cargo from falling into the wrong hands..."
