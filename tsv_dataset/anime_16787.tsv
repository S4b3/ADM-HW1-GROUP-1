animeDescription	"b'The term ""KiyaKiya"" comes from the old Japanese expression ""mune ga kiyakiya suru."" I first encountered it in Shibusawa Tatsuhiko\'s book Introductory Essays on Girls, in the chapter about ""childhood experiences."" The expression, which describes \xe2\x80\x9can enigmatic, nostalgic, disturbing feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d or an impression of \xe2\x80\x9cdeja-vu\xe2\x80\x9d, is at the origin of my ""KiyaKiya"" series.\n\nIn our everyday routine, there are moments when suddenly we feel like something is different; this unexpected change, like in my memory, feels like it has a kind of reality. This impression is at the core of \xe2\x80\x9cKiyaKiya\xe2\x80\x9d and the related painting and drawing series.\n\n(Source: Official website)'"
