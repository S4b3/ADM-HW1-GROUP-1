Naruto: Akaki Yotsuba no Clover wo Sagase	Special	1	2003-05-24 00:00:00		75695	6.54	41546	5929	1944	"When Konohamaru Sarutobi asks Naruto Uzumaki for help, the latter readily accepts to join his young friend on a special missionâ€”the retrieval of the legendary crimson four-leaf clover, rumored to have the ability to grant any wish. The miraculous plant is seemingly Konohamaru's only hope to prevent the departure of his sweetheart Kaede Yoshino, who must leave Konohagakure on account of her father's job. Despite the unique clover being located in a forbidden area, there is nothing stopping the two from bravely embarking on a perilous adventure to achieve their goal.
