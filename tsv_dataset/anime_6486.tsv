animeDescription	"Lamune and Da Cider head off to Puff-Puff Palace to rescue two beautiful barely clothed maidens, Gold Mountain and Silver Mountain- the Mountain Duo. This of course infuriates Milk and Leska, who with a rather confused and unwilling Cocoa ""transform"" into ""Seinaru Milky"", ""Seinaru Cacao"", and ""Seinaru Lemon"". The three then head after their would-be boyfriends to extract their revenge.
