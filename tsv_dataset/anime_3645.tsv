animeDescription	"Music video directed and animated by Ryoji Yamada for the song Prayer X by King Gnu

In the music video Prayer X, King Gnu takes an abstract and animated approach to mental health topics such as paranoia, anxiety, depression, and suicide. The setting is in a grey monotonous world where the main character is trapped inside a repetitive schedule which slowly drives him insane.
