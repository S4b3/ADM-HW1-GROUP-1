animeDescription	b'Music video directed and animated by Ryoji Yamada for the song Prayer X by King Gnu\n\nIn the music video Prayer X, King Gnu takes an abstract and animated approach to mental health topics such as paranoia, anxiety, depression, and suicide. The setting is in a grey monotonous world where the main character is trapped inside a repetitive schedule which slowly drives him insane.\n\n(Source: JROCK NEWS)'
