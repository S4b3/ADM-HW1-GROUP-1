animeDescription	"It's now back and is more extreme than ever. He pretends to be the resident manager Kato, and humiliates the girls in the dormitory. Shusaku is a lunatic. He couldn't finish his fiendish plan because Eri Takabe has insight into his plan. But, Shusaku's madness is not over. His deep revenge restarts the girl's nightmare. The sequence of the old man's masochism begins. The beautiful girls are puzzled and amazed. Again tonight... it's a man's showtime.
