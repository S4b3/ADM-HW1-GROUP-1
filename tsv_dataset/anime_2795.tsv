Along with his feathered partner Kir, Jing travels from town to town, stealing anything of value regardless of the amount of security. But when he's in a pinch, he has one more trick up his sleeve: Kir bonds with Jing's right arm to perform the effectively deadly ""Kir Royale"" attack. And because of all this, Jing is infamously known by many as the ""King of Bandits.""
