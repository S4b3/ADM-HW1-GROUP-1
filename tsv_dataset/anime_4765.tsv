Rising to protect humanity from these spiteful villains are warriors known as the Precure, whose heroic feats have garnered them celebrity status on television screens across the globe.\n\nHime Shirayuki, princess of the kingdom where the Axia was originally held, is one such warrior who transforms into ""Cure Princess"" to battle monsters summoned by the Empire.
