At a loss without their revolutionary leader, Area 11's resistance group\xe2\x80\x94the Black Knights\xe2\x80\x94find themselves too powerless to combat the brutality inflicted upon the Elevens by Britannia, which has increased significantly in order to crush any hope of a future revolt. \n\nLelouch Lamperouge, having lost all memory of his double life, is living peacefully alongside his friends as a high school student at Ashford Academy. His former partner C.C., unable to accept this turn of events, takes it upon herself to remind him of his past purpose, hoping that the mastermind Zero will rise once again to finish what he started, in this thrilling conclusion to the series.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n"""
