animeDescription	"Wanting to take her affection for Kobayashi a step further, dragon maid Tooru is confident in her latest creation: a love potion! With Valentine's Day just around the corner, Tooru decides there is no better way to use the potion than in homemade chocolates. However, on the special holiday, Tooru's plan is quickly foiled after Kobayashi sees through her heartfelt yet deceptive gift. 

Despite the unsuccessful attempt, many opportunities still await. Between the lively atmosphere and a trip to the hot springs, Kobayashi and the dragons indulge themselves in the sweet festivities.
