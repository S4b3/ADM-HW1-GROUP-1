animeDescription	"b""My name is Shimohei Joutarou. There is a reason that I'm here, at my new place of work, despite the fact that the school year hasn't started.\n\nOn that first day, I almost immediately came across Mitsuki's and Minami's secret. I then heard about Mahiru, younger sister of Classics teacher Kuji Hinako, and the astonishing improvement of her grades. I then discover indications of Hinako's backdoor maneuverings.\n\nNow, it is up to me to rehabilitate these students who break the rules.\n\n(Source: translated and adapted from official site by Cranston)"""
