animeDescription	b'The Japanese painter FUKAZAWA Takeshi expresses in pictures the novel written by Honor\xc3\xa9 de BALZAC \xe2\x80\x9cLa grenadi\xc3\xa8re\xe2\x80\x9d. Over 70 tempera paintings are beautifully brought to life and put together by FUKADA Koji for this Ga-nime that tells us the story of a mother and child in the 19th century, coated in a music that punctuates the whole experience. FUKAZAWA and FUKADA thus succeed in reproducing the ambiance of this mansion so dear to BALZAC, as the artistic pictures call to the imagination and the emotions of the viewer that only be so aroused by a Ga-nime.\n\n(Source: Toei)'
