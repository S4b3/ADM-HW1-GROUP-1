animeDescription	"Includes an animated promotional/opening video for the iOS/Android game Tales of the Rays and the main promotional video. Bandai Namco announced it was a sequel to Tales of the Rays and streamed the video on their official YouTube channel.

The game and videos star new characters Ickx Neve and Mileena Weiss along with a cast of returning characters from other Tales of games.

In a nontraditional manner, no new game app will be created, rather the current game app will receive a massive update and discontinue the main story line and start anew (several years later in-story) resetting the game play for all users. The story is said to take a darker tone.

The game's production was announced in 2015 and the official launch is expected some time later this year.
