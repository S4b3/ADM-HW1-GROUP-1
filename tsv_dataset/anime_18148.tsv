animeDescription	"The ceiling collapsed and a girl fell through from the second floor!?

Sousuke lives in a rundown apartment building where his only consolation is that the landlord is a beautiful woman and the girl who lives above him is cute.
One day though, the ceiling above him creaks and... Bang! In from the second floor, directly above him, the cute girl comes crashing down on himâ€¦!?

In an erotic encounter that can only be classified as a miracle, hearts and bodies are connected by chance. Then for some reason, he starts to live with both of these beautiful women!? Under this one roof, just what exactly will become of this crowded love triangle...!?
