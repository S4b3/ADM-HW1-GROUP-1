animeDescription	"It was Taisho Era. Morisaki Shinichiro and his little sister-in-law were managing a café that his dead mother had left. His father used to be an excellent scientist, but he began to absorb in studying ""android"". People began to cast cold eyes on him, and finally, he disappeared. After that, they two were living poor lives. One day, with a loud noise, an android girl dropped breaking the ceiling of the café. Then, their peaceful life suddenly turns into slapstick.
