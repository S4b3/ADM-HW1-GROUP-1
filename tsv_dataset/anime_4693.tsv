animeDescription	After experiencing two adventurous events, Wu Xie returned to Hangzhou from Nansha. During his training, he suddenly received an itchy call that he hadn't met for a long time. Lao Yi and Wu Xie told about their adventures in the hinterland of the Qinling Mountains three years ago, and invited Wu Xie to go on an adventure together and explore the ancient ruins. Wu Xie and Lao You set off for an expedition in the Qinling Mountains. Here, they saw the huge Zheluo salmon, the magnificent underground river waterfall, the incredible ancient sacred tree... And Zhang Qiling, who has always been out there, also secretly helped Wu Xie.
