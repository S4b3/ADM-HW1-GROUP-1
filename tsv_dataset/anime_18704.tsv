animeDescription	"The gorgeous, supernaturally powered Alicia has been kidnapped by demons and enslaved for their unspeakably perverted pleasures. Her only hope for survival is a team of busty barbarians known as the F-Force. Each fabulous fighting female has her own style and deadly weapon of choice, but all share a love of danger and excitement - and there will be plenty of both as they fight to rescue their comrade from the ravages of evil!
