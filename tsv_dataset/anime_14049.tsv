animeDescription	"b'Long, long ago there were two brothers, named Umihiko and Yamahiko. The older brother, Umihiko, made his living catching fish in the sea. The younger brother, Yamahiko, made his living hunting birds and animals in the mountains.\n\nOne day Yamahiko said to Umihiko, ""Why don\'t we exchange my bow and arrows for your fishing tackle, and trade places?"" After bothering him enough Umihiko agreed. The next day proved treacherous as they were unskilled. Umihiko hurt his arm and Yamahiko lost the fishing hook. Umihiko was extremely angered that Yamahiko\'s trade caused him to loose his prized hook, so even when his arm heals he\'d never be able to fish again the same. Yamahiko strives to right his wrongs.'"
