Chibi Airin no Yuruyaka na Nichijou	ONA	24	2018-04-16 00:00:00	2018-09-28 00:00:00	267			15171	14980	Real-life former SKE48 idol Airi Furukawa stars as herself, Airin, in a self made short manga she draws. The anime adaptation of her manga features odd characters such as a bewitched stuff bear and others named after mushrooms. The work is full of cuteness, laughs, and bizarre nonsense bordering surrealness.	[]	[]	[]	[]	https://myanimelist.net/anime/37647/Chibi_Airin_no_Yuruyaka_na_Nichijou
