animeDescription	"The OVA series Sonic Soldier Borgman serves as a sequel to the 1980s television series about an elite squad of bio-enhanced, crime-fighting humans known as Borgmen. Picking up several years after the dissolution of the original Borgman team, this volume reunites the three remaining members--rocket scientist Ryo, his girlfriend Anise, and police officer Chuck Sweager--for the emotionally-driven episode ""Lover`s Rain,"" which finds the trio facing an army of the undead bent on a rampage of murder and destruction.
