animeDescription	"An origins and highlight film showing how Mitsuo met the alien that gave him the equipment to become a superhero (which for some reason was never explicitly shown in the two main anime, both just start with Mitsuo already having the powers), how he works together with the other Permans, and the rowdy fight with the antagonists.

Screened simultaneously with Doraemon Movie 24: Nobita to Fushigi Kaze Tsukai."
