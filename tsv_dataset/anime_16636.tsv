animeDescription	"An anime starring Katta-kun, a real-life pelican who inhabited the Tokiwa Park in Ube.

In this movie, Katta-kun befriends Shu, a little boy whose parents went off to the Middle East because of their work. When war breaks out, Shu and Katta-kun travel to the Middle East to save Shu's parents and end the war.

Due to it's hilariously ridiculousness this movie achived cult status in Japan.
