Boku no Marie	OVA	3	1996-03-06 00:00:00	1996-08-21 00:00:00	4365	6.27	1676	7336	7405	Ever met the perfect girl? Did she have the perfect boyfriend? Feel like you can't compete? Why not build your own? When an amateur mad scientist attempts to build a robotic duplicate of this dream girl, Marie is the result. Of course, there are the usual unexpected complications. He built her so well that Marie has a mind of her own and a whole host of questions to go with it. The same questions that each of us ask of life. Where did I come from? Why am I here? Why do I look just like that girl over there?! Well, perhaps we donâ€™t all have to worry about that, but Marie does!
