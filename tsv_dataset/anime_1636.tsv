animeDescription	"b'Mekakucity Days is a series of music videos that tell the stories of some of the members of the ""Mekakushi-dan.""\n\nKagerou Daze\nIn the scorching heat haze of summer, Hibiya Amamiya feels every day is monotonous. On a swing in a park, he meets up with Hiyori Asahina, who gently strokes the cat in her arms. However, when the cat leaps away, Hiyori runs headlong into a never-ending tragedy\xe2\x80\x94and Hibiya will do whatever it takes to see her safe.\n\nHeadphone Actor\n""The end of the world is nigh,"" the news broadcast proclaims. Amidst the chaos, Takane Enomoto hears a voice in her headphones, asking if she wants to live. Following its directions, she races onward, but what awaits her may not be the salvation that she desires.\n\nSouzou Forest\nDue to her red eyes and white hair, everybody sees Mari Kozakura as a monster. Although she lacks the courage to do so, she dreams of escaping her house in the forest where she lives alone, imagining the world outside. Fortunately, her lonesome life begins to change with a simple knock on the door.\n\nKonoha no Sekai Jijou\nThe android-like being Konoha lacks many memories. What he recalls are feelings of longing, but by who and for who, he cannot place. What he does know, however, is that in the heat haze of summer, a young boy and girl face a tragedy. But fate is unchangeable, and his desperate attempts to save them can never seem to rewrite the future.\n\nToumei Answer\nShintarou Kisaragi knows how every day will go. Blessed with a photographic memory, he knows he will score full marks on his next exam, and he knows that Ayano Tateyama, the girl who sits next to him, will do poorly. But with his genius also comes unrelenting boredom; not even Ayano\'s bright smile and optimistic outlook can make him waver. His apathy may finally be broken, however, when Ayano does something that shakes Shintarou to his very core.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
