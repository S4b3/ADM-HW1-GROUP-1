animeDescription	"Kao Japan is a chemical and cosmetics company. They commissioned Tekken for a short to promote their cat litter and liner products. Chiisana Tayori, Ookina Tayori. means ""small news, big news."" where the small news is pee and the big news is poop. Urological diseases often found in cats are sometimes noticed in urine/small news.

Kao Japan wants owners to be more proactive in checking their cats' health. And their product is a special pellet kitty litter with a litter tray that has a drainage shelf. A special pad goes on the lower section which catches urine. Owners are able to then see the volume and color of the urine to know if their cat is sick which traditional kitty litter does not provide."
