animeDescription	"b""Dagon's little rocket crashes into a beautiful, blue planet and lands on a bed of green weeds. He quickly becomes friends with all kinds of creatures: Zipzap Mantis, General Ant Garibaldi, Andy Ant, Doctor Marilyn Wasp, and many more. Needless to say they are all insects. Insects? Yes, Dagon is only one centimetre tall!\n\nThe tiny residents of the land of weeds become curious about the identity of this stranger from another planet. But when Dagon saves them from the danger posed by their ferocious enemies, Gulpo Toad and Godzi Lizard, everyone thinks Dagon is a SUPER-BUG!\n\nThis planet is also home to a number of creatures that are very terrifying to these little fellows. They are called the Sapiens, or the human beings. Dagon must confront these massive creatures in order to get his rocket back from them!\n\nSo begins Dagon's funny and thrilling adventure on Earth...\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)"""
