animeDescription	"b'There was a rumour among the young people in Harajuku, Tokyo. There is a place called Ura-Harajuku somewhere in Harajuku, and it seems that there is a shop run by a witch. The witch\'s name is Nina. A young witch with a chameleon and a pig fulfills the secret wishes of her guests. Her method is to invite her to a mysterious space and look into the ""real feelings"" deep inside her heart. Customers are sometimes excited, sometimes hurt, and make their own choices to fulfill their wishes.\n\n(Source: AniDB)'"
