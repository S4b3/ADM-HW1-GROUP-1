animeDescription	"On the Ryoku Tama Shinshi DVD release there were 10 short stories included. These original stop-motion animation stories were not present in the feature film. The first short story is actually a prequel to the feature film telling the viewer why Monsieur Greenpeas went the the city. The rest of the episodes are more side-stories and flesh out the characters.
