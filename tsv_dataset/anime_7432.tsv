The world's first experience simulation game park ""Amber Crystal"" opened in Chiba Prefecture. Opening day only allows couples inside with a special ticket. Seiko and cameraman Hayakawa, Mamoru and Junko-sensei are there to meet up. While saying ""because it is a game, it's okay to do anything"", Mamoru guards as a knight figure to raise XP to steadily power up. Meanwhile, Seiko who became a mage, realized that this game park is the invasion of the space monster and goes on to approach the final boss of the game."
