animeDescription	"""I've been holding a few words back for a long time — I like you!""
""Beryl and Sapphire"" is a popular manhua created by artist Ocarina. Here includes protagonists with the most random names in history  — the mild-mannered Beryl (Green) and the easily-embarrassed Sapphire (Blue). At times the closest of friends, at others the worst of enemies… In this donghua where each episode is set in a different world, how would they encounter each other time and again?? Only angst? Too painful! Nothing but fluff? Too sugary! Come watch B&S, the show where you'll never guess the ending…
