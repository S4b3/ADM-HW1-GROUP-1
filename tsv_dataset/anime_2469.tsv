animeDescription	"b'In the dangerous suburbs of Chicago, skilled bounty hunters Irene ""Rally"" Vincent and ""Minnie"" May Hopkins run Gunsmith Cats, a firearms store of questionable legality. One day, Bill Collins, an agent for the Chicago branch of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, blackmails Rally and May into working with him on a case. The stakes are high, but Rally\xe2\x80\x99s gunmanship and May\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of explosives are unmatched. As Rally and May unravel the secrets of the case, the two will need to use guns and grenades while being faster, stronger, and better than everyone else in order to stay alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
