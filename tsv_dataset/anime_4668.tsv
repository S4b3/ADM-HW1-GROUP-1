animeDescription	"Children Record features two songs, the titular one serving as an opening to the Kagerou Project song series.

Kisaragi Attention
For the ultra-popular idol Momo Kisaragi, going out in public is nearly impossible. No matter what, she always seems to capture everyone's attention. She's not even that talented! With so many doubts, one would think she might as well quit. However, after meeting with the ""Mekakushi-dan,"" Momo may finally find a place to belong.

Children Record
Long ago, the heat-haze began drawing in victims, granting them red-eyed powersâ€”but these powers bring more pain than good. Through the despair, these affected children push ever onward to a future full of hope.
