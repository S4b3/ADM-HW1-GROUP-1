animeDescription	"Having cleared the preliminaries, twenty-four pairs of twins face gargantuan challenges on an enormous athletic field. On this man-made island in Tokyo Bay, the bonds between twins are pushed to the limit in the Ultimate Athletic Tournament!

The tournament consists of three insanely difficult obstacle courses. Teamwork and human drama are forged within these grueling challenges.

Participants are limited to twins, but exactly what constitutes a ""twin"" is unclear, resulting in some unusual pairings. In the past, controversial appearances have included clones, adopted siblings, or triplets in shifts.
