animeDescription	"About 700 million years ago, the Earth was covered in ice, becoming a white planet â€“ a snowball Earth. It is said that this continued for millions of years... This time, Doraemon and his friends set off to an icy, wintry, freezing journey to find a hotter, crazier, and more exciting adventure than ever before!
