animeDescription	"A song originally used in the children's television program Hirake Ponkikki. The popular CD was originally released in 1975. In 2008, it was released alongside an anime DVD with a music video.

The song starts by expressing how Taiyaki-kun and other taiyaki pancakes are fed up with being relentlessly cooked up on a hot plate day after day. In the song, Taiyaki-kun escapes to the sea, but ends up being caught and eaten by an angler.
