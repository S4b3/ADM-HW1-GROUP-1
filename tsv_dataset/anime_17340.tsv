animeDescription	"b""Based off of a story arc from Osamu Tezuka's Tetsuwan Atom, Pluto follows the Europol detective Gesicht as he tries to uncover the mystery behind a string of robot and human deaths. The case becomes much more puzzling when evidence leans toward the murders being the work of a robot, which is something that hasn't happened for 8 years.\n\n(Source: ANN)"""
