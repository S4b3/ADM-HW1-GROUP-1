animeDescription	"b'Music video directed and animated by Rabbit MACHINE for the song Thoughtcrime by Yorushika.\n\nThe theme of thoughtcrime is plagiarized from George Orwell\'s novel, ""1984."" Then, the moment it was declared that it\'s plagiarized, the plagiarized work changed form into a homage. The line between doing plagiarism and doing a homage seems ambiguous, and the truth is that that line doesn\'t exist anywhere. It holds true even when the role is reversed. A homage holds a great risk of becoming plagiarism. The lyrics to this song pays homage to Ozaki Housai\'s haiku and his final years of life.\n\n(Source: YouTube)'"
