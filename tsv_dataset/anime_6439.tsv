His own life appalls him, but he has one escape \xe2\x80\x93 his online life. Gaming has become his everything, and he excels at it.\n\nAfter another long, lonely night of gaming, he wakes up \xe2\x80\x93 and is shocked to find that he has transformed into a woman. Or to be more precise, a woman who looks a lot like those he used to lust after online! Confused, he does not know where to turn \xe2\x80\x93 so looks for answers on the net. He encounters a young woman in a chat forum named Sae Mi, who offers him advice. He soon falls for her charms \xe2\x80\x93 which makes things complicated to say the least.
