It turns out that the movie pirate wasn\'t a pirate after all\xe2\x80\x94it was an android time machine, and Gintoki has been hurtled five years into the future!

Determined to confront a powerful foe, he makes an important discovery\xe2\x80\x94with a ragtag band of friends and allies at his side, he doesn\'t have to fight alone.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
