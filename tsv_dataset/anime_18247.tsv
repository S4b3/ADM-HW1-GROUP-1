animeDescription	"b'Keisuke Iwasaki is a popular high school PE teacher by day and the notorious ""Rapeman"" at night. As a masked avenger, he collaborates with his uncle, a former surgeon, to dispense his brand of justice on behalf of clients who seek the assistance of their business, ""Rapeman Services."" Be it exacting vengeance on an ex-lover, mending the relationship between a daughter and her parents, or suppressing the anger of a disgruntled employee, Keisuke never falters in completing his assigned contracts. Whenever corrupt women wander, the Rapeman arrives to forcibly change their sullied hearts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
