Count Desleen, after years of being thwarted by the Baron Jeek of Barenheim, creates a devious plot to trap and exact revenge upon the Baron. Under the guise of hosting the largest tournament ever seen, Desleen plans to gather together all the legendary warriors from all the far away lands and destroy them. But as with all plans, there are always wildcards. Like the mysterious female warrior Nerise, who has been hunting Jeek for many years. Will she help Jeek or kill him? Will Desleen's servants from Hell drain her of all her strength and kill Jeek in the tournament? Can Jeek beat Desleen and his clan warriors and save the Crossland from their evil plans?  """
