animeDescription	"This is a song meant for a kindergartener's graduation ceremony. Many tears will be shed this season for the students moving up to Junior high school, leaving 6 years of fun, frolic, and memories behind. But the circle begins again for the fresh-faced, cute little 6-year-olds to start the journey that each child must inevitably travel.
