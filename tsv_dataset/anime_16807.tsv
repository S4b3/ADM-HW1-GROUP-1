animeDescription	"Koala no Goodbye Song was originally an animated music video piece projected onto stone structures for the 2016 Animal Light festival. The festival was a collaboration between Kanazawa Zoo and light artists. The zoo was open after hours to showcase illuminated works, mix media, and installations. Asami posted a live recording of her piece about a year later on her official YouTube channel. It featured a main koala playing a guitar and singing with two other koalas playing maracas and a few other animals.

Then in 2019 Asami released a piano version of the song with new animation focusing on the main koala playing the piano from behind."
