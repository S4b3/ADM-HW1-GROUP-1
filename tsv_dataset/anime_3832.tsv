She is extremely afraid of getting her skin touched. The curious life of the strange girl changes little by little.\n\nThere are men who seek to capture Yuki.  It is said that Yuki has a power which holds the fate of the world, and they want her to sacrifice herself for the world. What is the power within Yuki? Why does she refuse to be touched?
