The reinforced cardboard would soon become the battleground for a popular children's hobby called ""LBX"" (Little Battler eXperience).

Four years later, a boy named Yamano Ban who loves to play with LBX (although without a mecha himself) is given a case containing the model AX-00 by a mysterious woman.
