animeDescription	"b'In 2046, a revolutionary 80% shock-absorbing reinforced cardboard has been developed, rapidly transforming the world\'s exports. The reinforced cardboard would soon become the battleground for a popular children\'s hobby called ""LBX"" (Little Battler eXperience).\n\nFour years later, a boy named Yamano Ban who loves to play with LBX (although without a mecha himself) is given a case containing the model AX-00 by a mysterious woman. He is told that he now holds the hopes and despairs of mankind in his hands.'"
