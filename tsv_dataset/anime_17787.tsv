animeDescription	"This is the sequel to Imouto Paradise!.

It’s summer vacation and Keiichi’s parents left him with his five younger sisters to go on an overseas trip. Now with their parents far out of the picture, his younger sisters are aggressively making their moves on him. Of course there’s no way he can hold back.
