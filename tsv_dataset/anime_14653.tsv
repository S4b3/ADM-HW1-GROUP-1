Zhu Zhu Xia: Konglong Riji	TV	104	2019-04-29 00:00:00	2019-08-27 00:00:00	188			14653	16315	"A more educational season of GG Bond. This season is composed of 2 arcs, each arc has 52 episodes.

GG Bond works on cleaning up some fossils at the lab as they'll be used in a museum exhibit. He uses a fossil to create a data coin that is compatible with his special jet. This allows for him to travel back in time to the original animal (a T-Rex) the fossil was made of. While GG Bond is ecstatic to learn about dinosaurs in-person (as well as mine more accurate data for the data coin), he didn't quite realize the danger he'd be in. He successfully gets out of this sticky situation but there's still a lot more dinosaurs he needs to get information on."
