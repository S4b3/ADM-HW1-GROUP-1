animeDescription	"b""Men are the enemies... \n\nAs a young girl, Yumi (Yoshimi Terada) watched her mother leave her father, and her father bring in other women. She grew to hate her father and all men. Time has passed, and now Yumi is a nurse. But that is only her day job. Being a queen is her true calling. What will happen when Hiroyuki Ando, a former patient of hers who fell madly in love with her, finds out that she's not the gentle, caring person he thought he knew? \n\n(Source: AniDB)"""
