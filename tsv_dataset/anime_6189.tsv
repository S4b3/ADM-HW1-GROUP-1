animeDescription	b'In the northern Kanto area in Japan, there is Binan City\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nAt Binan High School, as per usual, the \xe2\x80\x9cEarth Defense Club (lol)\xe2\x80\x9d was a club that did nothing. The club members Kyoutarou Shuzenji, Ryouma Kirishima, Nanao Wakura, Taishi Manza, and Ichiro Dogou nonchalantly enjoyed tea while having pointless conversations that amount to nothing.\n\nAll of them have now gathered at Kurotama Bath after school. When Ryouma pulls Kyoutarou Shuzenji by his arm out of water that he claims feels too good, together with his towel comes a pretty boy in strange clothing.\n\nThese five boys are then dragged into a battle for the heir of the magical kingdom, Honila Land...\n\n(Source: KA)'
