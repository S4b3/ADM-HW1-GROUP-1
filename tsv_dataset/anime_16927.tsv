animeDescription	"Mizuki Kiyama's short animation utilizes a paint on glass technique to render a young girl's visit to a neighborhood sento (bath house) with her mother with dazzling sensuous wonder. Evoking child-like fascination at daily rituals, this quotidian act amidst feminine intimacy becomes a space of otherworldly fantasy.
