animeDescription	"Two men are playing rock-paper-scissors, but this version has a painful twist: whoever loses the round will be whacked on the head with a mallet. A bowl will offer them protection from the blow but only if they are quick enough to grab it. Tension builds as the game begins. What will the outcome be?
