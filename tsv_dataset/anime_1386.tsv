animeDescription	"b""Upon her return to Japan after a two year study break in Paris, Ichigo Amano is met with news of Team Ichigo's separation, as each of the Sweets Princes takes a different path toward their dream. Now in her first year of high school, Henri Lucas has a project in store for her, enlisting the help of Ichigo, Makoto Kashino, and new members Lemon Yamagishi and Johnny McBeal to give rise to a new Team Ichigo. As the four work together on this project, Ichigo and Makoto continue to grow closer, though Johnny and the unrelenting Miya Koshiro will not idly sit by; with Johnny's eye on Ichigo and Miya still after Makoto, it definitely seems like love won't come easily.\n\nWith Ichigo's time at St. Marie Academy, she is now ever closer to her dream of starting her very own p\xc3\xa2tisserie. However, she will soon realize that it takes more than just making delicious sweets to open up a shop.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
