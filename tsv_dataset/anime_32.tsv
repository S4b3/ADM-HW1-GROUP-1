The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.\n\nMellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels\xe2\x80\x94Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong\xe2\x80\x94the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member\'s dark and mysterious past little by little.\n\nWell-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
