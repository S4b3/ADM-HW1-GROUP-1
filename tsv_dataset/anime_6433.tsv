animeDescription	"A few days before Fox officially inherits the treasured heirloom in his familyâ€”a mysterious map, the Tufugu Pirates storm into his house and kidnap him, taking the strange map with them.

Buta, a powerful mercenary, is hired by shady characters to help them seek the treasure. In a stroke of great luck, Buta and Fox meet in the underbelly of a pirate ship. Will Fox be able to convince Buta to save him, or will the fabled treasure fall into the hands of crooks?
