animeDescription	"This is a 2:15 (4:30 including the rerun) short created to promote the (JRA) Japan Racing Association's Umabi service.

VAs used in the short:

First half:
Popuko: Mikako Komatsu
Pipimi: Sumire Uesaka

Second half:
Popuko: Ryuusei Nakao
Pipimi: Norio Wakamoto

This is the same combination of VAs that was used for episode 3 of the TV series.
