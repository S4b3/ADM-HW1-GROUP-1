animeDescription	While playing hide and seek, Keroppi and the gang find some dinosaur bones. With the village elder they dig out more and put the bones back together and find out it was a baby dinosaur. In the nearby museum there is a mama dinosaur on display and as night falls the baby dinosaur's skeleton comes to life in search of its mother. The gang tries to help it reunite it and the cries of the baby dinosaur skeleton animate the mama's skeleton. Once together again their souls ascend to heaven and both skeletons become displayed lovingly at the museum.
