animeDescription	Based on the erotic game by Tinker Bell. Mibuu Kyousuke is a detective who finds himself lost in the mountains where he dreams of a girl who is involved in an obscene ritual of torture and molestation by deformed old men and a bull.  When he finds a house he meets the girl from his dreams (Yukino) and decided he wants to save her.  Yukino thanks him for his kindness but begs him to leave since it is dangerous for outsiders.  The longer Kyousuke stays at the house the more he finds himself being overtaken by desire.  Will he be able to save Yukino and her family from their nightly torture or will he become a victim himself?
