animeDescription	b'A stop-motion music video of bitter melon superhero named Gouyaaman (Bittermelonman). It is originally based on an insert song from the live-action TV series Churasan where Gouyaaman was an in-story yuru-chara a character created to help promote tourism to the dying town. In the TV series, Gouyaaman was a failure and the butt of jokes. Unprecedentedly, the TV series was popular and Gouyaaman became a real-life yuru-chara in Okinawa with merchandising.'
