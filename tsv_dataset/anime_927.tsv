The band members put in their utmost effort in practicing for their goal\xe2\x80\x94to enter nationals.\n\nThe now second-year Kumiko Oumae, along with her friends, is met with the new and quirky batch of first-years, resulting in friction and conflict between the band members. However, as time passes, their inner feelings slowly unravel, but not every conflict is as easy to solve as the other.
