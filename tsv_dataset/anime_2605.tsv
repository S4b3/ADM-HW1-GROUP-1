Somewhere along the line, Chiaki brings up the Yamanashi Kids' Stamp Rally, which Nadeshiko has never heard of. The rally encourages one to visit famous places in the prefecture and collect stamps; those who complete the rally will win a year's worth of Minobu steamed buns. Enticed by the humongous food prize, Nadeshiko is set on participating.

Follow the Outdoor Activities Club as they travel around the Yamanashi prefecture to collect stamps and explore what the region has to offer!
