animeDescription	b'In a totalitarian and male chauvinist world, a female high-heeled shoe named Mulan Hua rebels against the baby shoe factory to protect her baby girl from being transformed into a male shoe. To raise her daughter, she later has to disguise herself as a male sturdy shoe and works day and night in a capitalist cigarette factory. The story is not only about a mother\xe2\x80\x99s sacrifice and a feminist\xe2\x80\x99s revenge, but also has a political undertone of the intoxication of power.\n\n(Source: mulanfestival.com)'
