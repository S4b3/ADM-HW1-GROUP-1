animeDescription	"Gougou, the man who deals with himself, strangers and the society as a whole at his own pace. He tends to confuse his surroundings beginning with his unique name, but surprisingly his job is upholding law and order as policeman; however, his way of life as modern time policeman leaves his superiors, civilians and even criminals dumbfounded. It's the new type of police comedy the Heisei-era has brought forth.
