animeDescription	"A boy and his sister are nearly eaten by their father and they rush out of the house. They run away in their fatherâ€™s car and wind up in the wilderness, where they meet a Giant and a Witch. This animation film in black & white charcoal drawings uses the sound of a bass guitar and combines a Japanese Manga feel with a fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm.
