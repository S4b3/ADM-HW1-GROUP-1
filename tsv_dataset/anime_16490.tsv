animeDescription	A cat parody of Kagaku Ninja-tai Gatchaman. Tatsunoko Productions announced the project on Nyan Nyan Nyan day (aka Cat Day on February 22) earlier this year with character designs by Iwata Naomi (director of Pingu in the City). Episodes finally began streaming by NTV on various platforms but oddly the original character designs were not used.
