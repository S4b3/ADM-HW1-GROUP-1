animeDescription	"In the twelve years of Tianbao, Kong Hongjun, a handsome young man who is not familiar with the world, left the Yaojin Palace on the Taihang Mountain with three important tasks, and came to Chang'an, which is full of prosperity. Kong Hongjun first entered the Datang Exorcism Division, and the head supervisor was actually Long Wujun general Li Jinglong who had dealt with it not long ago. But he accidentally broke the Chen's heart lamp, and the heart lamp entered Li Jinglong's body. In the light and shadow of the lamp, there are the bright red lights of Pingkangli, the exorcism of the sycamore in the summer sunshine, the vast sky and sand and flying snow, the peaceful singing of Artai. Mo Rigen and Lu Xu picked off early morning leaves, Qiu Yongsi's flying strokes.
