animeDescription	"b""Inako is a minor country, enclosed by two superior countries: the militaristic Milidonia, with its goal of conquering as much land as possible, and the monotheiestic Selenfalen, devoted to the deity Saint Philia. Ani Inako is the sole princess of her country, and in order to eliminate hostility between the three countries, she is sent as Inako's representative to a peace treaty signing in Selenfalen. However, Ani's hopes of a smooth ceremony are shattered when she meets the eccentric princes from her rival countries.\n\nWith the treaty binding the three countries together, Ani and the princes must learn to overcome their differences. Together, they search for common ground on which to develop their friendship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
