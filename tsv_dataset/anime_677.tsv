animeDescription	"Two OVA episodes featuring additional stories. 

Episode 0: Ritsu and Takano used to date back in high school, but broke up due to a misunderstanding. This is that story. 

Episode 12.5: Hatori and Chiaki go to visit the latter's family. It's really awkward in many, many ways. "
