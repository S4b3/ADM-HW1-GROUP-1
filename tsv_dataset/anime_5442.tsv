animeDescription	"b'After the world ran out of all traditional energy sources, only one remained\xe2\x80\x94human excrement. To encourage citizens to produce as much waste as possible, the government implants a chip in the anus at birth, which provides citizens with ""juicybars"" every time it detects defecation. Juicybars are highly addictive narcotics that sometimes transform their users into mutant blue dwarfs with extreme constipation. These mutant addicts make up the ""Diaper Gang,"" those who live underground and are focused on trying to obtain juicybars.\n\nAachi and Ssipak are two small-time crooks who steal and sell juicybars to make it on the streets. When they meet a beautiful woman who has the anal chips of every Diaper Gang member implanted in her, producing dozens of juicybars with every dump, Aachi and Ssipak strike it rich. However, with both the government and the Diaper Gang on their tails, the two struggle to protect their newfound riches.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
