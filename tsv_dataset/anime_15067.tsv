animeDescription	"The new Break Go!Ga! toy line for boys is about combining the love of construction vehicles with battle bots, creating a customizable brawl of heavy duty equipment. Bandai is kicking off the toys' debut with a three-minute animated commercial demonstrating, albeit with some enhanced for animation abilities, the appeal of creating the best bot and crushing your opponent. The anime ad shows Red Cyclone and Slash Panzer's attacks.
