He dies, turning into a pile of ash, at the slightest shock.\n\nAfter Vampire Hunter Ronaldo learned of a castle inhabited by a vampire rumoured to have kidnapped a kid, he went there intending to take the devil down. However, the vampire turned out to be Draluc, a wimp who keeps turning into ash at the smallest things. Moreover, the kid wasn\'t being held captive\xe2\x80\x94he was just using the ""haunted house"" as his personal playground!\n\nWhen his castle is destroyed, Draluc moves into Ronaldo\'s office, much to the other\'s chagrin. Despite their differences, they must try to work together to defend themselves from rogue vampires, Ronaldo\'s murderous editor, investigators, and more\xe2\x80\x94with Draluc dying continuously along the way. \n\n(Source: MU, amended)'"
