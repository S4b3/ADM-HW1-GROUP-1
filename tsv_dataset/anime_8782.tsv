animeDescription	"In a world where negative emotions fester, five fairies from the strongest clans are sent to Earth to collect ""attachment"" in order to sustain their world. The fairies establish Bar F and live their lives as normal high school boys and a barkeep in order to protect their true identities and fulfill their mission. The boys encounter various female clientele at Bar F, each hiding dark feelings within their hearts, and the boys offer to help them overcome their troubles. The only thing they ask for in return is the client's permission to steal their heart.

As the boys investigate the cause of each client's distress, they come across an individual who wishes to sow chaos and sin. With their quest on the line, the fairies of Bar F must unmask this individual's identity and put a stop to their plans, all while holding true to themselves.
