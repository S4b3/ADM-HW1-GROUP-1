animeDescription	"b'Michael the orange tiger cat returns for another series of vignettes.\n\nThe sketches this time include a three-part send-up of The Fugitive, the famous 1960\'s TV show. Richard Kimble is now a veterinarian on the lam (lamb?), running from a false conviction for a murder committed by ""a man with overbite."" Despite the omnipresent danger, he must stoop and intervene whenever he sees a cat (always Michael) suffering; after treating the patient, he plays a trick on the cat and runs away. (He\'s a fugitive, after all.) Another sketch draws parallels between wandering husbands and wandering house cats, who seem to have similar proclivities. Two more point out what happens when a cat\'s instincts run up against the requirements of baseball or pro wrestling.\n\n(Source: Orphan Fansubs)'"
