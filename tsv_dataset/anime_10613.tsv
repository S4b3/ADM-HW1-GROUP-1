animeDescription	"Glico, the prominent food manufacturer best known for its pretzel stick snacks Pocky and Pretz, has long relied on its classic running man character and real-life celebrities to promote its products. Now it has finally bowed to prevailing trends and introduced two moe-style anime characters to broadcast its message.

Lico and Gli are twin brother and sister magicians dedicated to making the world tastier. A newly posted music video has Lico sing (via Vocaloid) about granting everyone's wishes with her sparkly magic.
