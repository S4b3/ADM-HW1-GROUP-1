animeDescription	"Unlike the main television anime series which is mostly set in modern-day Japan, the new series will be a ""sealed room"" suspense comedy set 100 years in the future. The story begins when Shinnosuke and the entire Nohara family wake up from cold sleep to find themselves aboard a space ship drifting in space. The anime will depict the various events that take place inside the ship. (Source: ANN)"
