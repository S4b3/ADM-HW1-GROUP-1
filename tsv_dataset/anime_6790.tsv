animeDescription	"b'Unlike most shows the three episodes are not only totally unrelated to each other but really don\'t follow a plot as such and are more a light hearted jibe at both the Patlabor series (TV and films) and other ""mecha"" Anime. Episode 1 is a brief introduction to the weaponry carried by the Ingram and how it was designed and why it is the way it is. Episode 2 looks at the design and maintenance of the Ingram 98 AV in SVU2 and takes a swipe at the marketing forces behind them (as in merchandising for the series). Episode 3 is the only one to attempt to expand on a very minor point raised in the original TV show and just how SVU2 is actually funded.\n\n(Source: ANN)'"
