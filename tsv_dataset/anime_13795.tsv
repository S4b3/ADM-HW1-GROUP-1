animeDescription	"b'A short music lyric video for Syudan Koudou song\'s The Crater whose single was released on the same day. The band formally spells their name as Syudan Koudou but its proper romanization is Shuudan Koudou as their name literally means ""Collective Action.""\n\nThe Crater is composed of watercolor animation, particularly its space/atmosphere background which never recycles the same watercolor painting, with each frame being a differently painted segment.'"
