animeDescription	b'While it may seem like a mere depiction of everyday life, The Sound of Your Heart is a comedy filled to the brim with wit, sarcasm, and parody. It gives no regard for the probable or realistic- it is a series of absurd situations that is sure to get a laugh out of every reader willing to suspend their sense of reality.\n\n(Source: LINE Webtoon)'
