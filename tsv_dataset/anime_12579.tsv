animeDescription	"High above the clouds, meat-loving Zeushi-kun is the prince of 'Nikuniku Land'! He and his pal Minota think about meat every day! (Oh, they like veggies too.) Right now, they're freeloading down on the surface with the Miito family so they can discover all sorts of tasty domestic meat products.

With lively scenes of delicious meat lined up across the Miito family's dinner table, the anime presents the wonders of livestock and agricultural products, with an emphasis on domestic meat, in a fun and easy to understand way."
