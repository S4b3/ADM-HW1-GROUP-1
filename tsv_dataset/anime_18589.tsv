How about Lina, the perky and agile sports girl who's had a crush on Jun for years? And then there's the mysterious Mina, the fiery redhead with a sharp tongue and a hot body who's just reappeared in his life...\n\nThree very different sisters, but all have the same needs and desires. Will Jun ever be able to pick just one?\n\n(Source: AniDB)"""
