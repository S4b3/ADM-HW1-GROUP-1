animeDescription	"b'Frazzle-haired middle schooler Inari Fushimi is less than average; she\'s painfully shy and horribly clumsy, but despite all this, she is undeniably kind. Running about the winding streets of her hometown, she takes a shortcut through the local shrine and stumbles upon a small fox pup in a river. After rescuing him, she continues on, but from this moment on, her life takes a drastic turn.\n\nGrateful for rescuing the pup, the shrine goddess Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami, ""Uka-sama,"" grants Inari a fragment of her power. Now, Inari has the ability to transform into anyone by shouting the magical phrase ""Inari, konkon."" Could this power also grant her the courage to convey her feelings to her crush, Kouji Tanbabashi? With her new heavenly ability and the fox spirit Kon, Inari forms a sincere friendship with Uka-sama, encounters more of the supernatural world, and learns that true love knows no bounds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
