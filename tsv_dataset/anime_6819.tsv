Sara who opens up her heart to Sinbad reveals her horrible story of how her father’s apprentice Galip destroyed the peaceful kingdom and her family by using the wizardly power. Suddenly the Magic Lamp shows the passage “to the Wonder Gate to the land of ancestors that appears in the Night at High Noon,” but Galip’s solders block their path.
