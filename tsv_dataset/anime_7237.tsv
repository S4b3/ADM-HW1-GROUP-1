Before Ryer and the others, different forms of Misaki appear. The\nMisaki from training school, the Misaki from her childhood days.\n\nAre these reflections caused by the conflicts that exist inside Misaki?\n\nShe awakens a second time and when she derives the response, that history is leading\ninto a completely differnet direction now.\n\nWill Misaki, Ryer and the others be able to find a real happy end?!\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)'"
