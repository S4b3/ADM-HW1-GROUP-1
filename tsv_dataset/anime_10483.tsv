Now, these mysterious aliens have returned to halt mankind\'s expansion into space ...by force.\n\nNow, the planet named after the God of War will become our final battlefield, as mankind fights a desperate battle with the latest in high-tech, military hardware: hyper-advanced aircraft, orbital fighters, and gigantic, desert battleships brimming with the most advanced weaponry.\n\nBut will it be enough? The aliens have awesome, incredibly destructive weapons at their disposal\xe2\x80\x94including ""Hell""\xe2\x80\x94an unstoppable stealth carrier.

But Akuh\'s girlfriend is showing signs of nymphomania\xe2\x80\x94the first symptom of alien subversion!\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)'"
