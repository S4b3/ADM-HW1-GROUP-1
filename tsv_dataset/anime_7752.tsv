animeDescription	"b""One morning, Wataru Hoshino found a sleeping girl\xe2\x80\x94in nothing but her underwear\xe2\x80\x94in his room. When she woke up, she quickly escaped by jumping out of the window, but not without punching Wataru in the face first. This girl, Rinna Sawaki, ends up being a transfer student of Wataru's school, as well as the new roommate of Wataru's dormitory.\n\nWataru lives with four other girls and their school teacher, but due to Temizugawa Heavy Industry's cancellation of their aviation branch\xe2\x80\x94South Sakojima Island's major company\xe2\x80\x94the families involved with the corporation have to be evacuated in one year. As a result of this, the four girls have to leave the island in one year's time.\n\nKnowing this, Rinna refuses to become friends with Wataru and the other girls, because of the pain that she might experience as a result of their eventual separation; however, Wataru disagrees with her, and over the course of the year, tries to convince her otherwise.\n\n(Source: ANN)"""
