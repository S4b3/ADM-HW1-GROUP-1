animeDescription	"b""Professor Sayaka is a popular new girl on campus. She's well-liked and friendly to everyone. In fact, she's a little too friendly, in the dean's mind. She's a shameless flirt and needs to be put in her place. Maybe he's right. During Sayaka's last teaching position, she fell in love with Shin, one of her students, and the scandal forced her to move on to another college.\n\n(Source: AniDB)"""
