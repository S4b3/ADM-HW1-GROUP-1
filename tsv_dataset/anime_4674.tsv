animeDescription	"Pikupiku, Shirushiru, and Korokoro are three fairies that live on a floating island. Whether they're chatting about the weird things they encounter in their daily lives, goofing off in the enchanted ""Room of Light and Magic,"" or gazing into their looking pool that shows bizarre worlds, the fairies are always having fun in whatever way they can.
