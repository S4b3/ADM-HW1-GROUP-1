animeDescription	b'Urban legends told throughout Japan are meant to frighten the population, mainly those of school age, through stories involving abnormal entities or supernatural occurrences. But what happens when this folklore turns into pleasurable encounters with paranormal ladies? \n\nThe stories of Hanako Hasegawa, a trapped girl with a tragic past; Sadako, a woman who can only appear virtually; Hachishaku-sama, a god who has been forgotten; and Mary, a thrown away doll, join together in a truly climactic narrative.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'
