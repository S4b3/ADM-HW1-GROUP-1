animeDescription	"b'The story is set on Okinawa\'s isolated island of Iwado, which has seen a growing movement advocating a return to an autonomous government. Ao Fukai, a 12-year-old boy with a missing father, lives on the island with an old doctor named Toshio and is about to enter middle school. Ao\'s mother was taken away a decade ago by unknown individuals. Naru Arata, Ao\'s 12-year-old childhood friend and the story\'s heroine, lives with her father, older sister, and grandmother. She has a ""Yuta"" power awakened within her due to an incident when she was young. A mysterious entity called ""Secret"" suddenly appears and launches an attack on the Scub Coral lifeform on the island. Ao launches a certain military FP called ""Nirvash"" aboard a Japanese military transport in his fervent desire to protect the island. \n\n(Source: FUNimation) '"
