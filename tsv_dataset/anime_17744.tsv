animeDescription	"b'Masato Majime has never been the popular type. Addicted to pornography, he has always been perceived as a weirdo and avoided by most people. Everything changes, however, when he saves a mysterious stray cat. It turns out that the cat is able to speak, and as a token of gratitude, she gives Majime the ""Smartphone of Love."" Equipped with dozens of Ero-apps, the phone is able to activate events in real life, fulfilling every sex fantasy of its owner.\n\nArmed with his new powers, Majime seduces girls that would otherwise never even grace him with a look. He builds a harem of horny lovers, head-over-heels for their new master.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
