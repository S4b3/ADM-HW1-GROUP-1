animeDescription	"At Hope's Peak Academy, a school full of extraordinarily talented individuals, Nagito Komaeda is an ordinary boy with no special traits or interesting skills to speak ofâ€”except for his incredible unluckiness. Just walking to school in the morning leads to a number of unfortunate accidents, which only escalate as the day goes on. Despite this, Komaeda leads a relatively normal life and is satisfied with his modest slice of happiness.

But everything changes when a mysterious boy who declares himself the ""Destroyer of the World"" arrives to shatter this hopeless paradise.
