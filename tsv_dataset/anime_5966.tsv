animeDescription	"Somewhere, there was a young man. A kind hearted young man who loved animals but, the most unfortunate things happen to him. The place where he works going bankrupt, bumping into a signboard as he walks in the streets. He is just completely burdened with bad luck.

However, his life completely changes when he meets a fortune teller. With the power of the fortune teller, ""Guardian Angels"" are called through a mobile phone and a group of cute girls appear.
