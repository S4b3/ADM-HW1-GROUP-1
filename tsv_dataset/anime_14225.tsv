animeDescription	"b""A long time ago, there was a very beautiful bird with beautiful feathers and a sweet singing voice. Other birds admired her. As autumn approached, the birds were busy building nests and storing food to prepare for the winter, but she was the only one who didn't do anything and wandered in the forest. \n\nWhen winter came, the beautiful bird had no nest to go to and no food to eat. However, she found a bonfire and flew over to keep warm. When she began to feel complacent, her body caught on fire. She was able to put out the fire on her body, but her feathers were scorched by the fire and had turned black, and her voice became hoarse and unpleasant."""
