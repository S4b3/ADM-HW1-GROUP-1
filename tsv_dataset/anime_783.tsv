animeDescription	"Life in rural Asahigaoka moves at its own pace. Devoid of the pleasures and worries of a bustling metropolis, this small village might seem painfully dull at first glance. However, despite living this far from her hometown of Tokyo, Hotaru Ichijou manages to find a group of friends whom she can spend quality time with. No matter whether it's winter, spring, summer, or fall, they make full use of everything the nature around them has to offer.
