animeDescription	b'Valkyrie was a female fighter whom Odin was proud of. She was noble, full of love, and pure. She was an invincible fighter on the battlefield. However, because of the betrayal of a goddess, Freya, she was captured. She was robbed of her ring, which was the source of her power, and her arms. Being excited upon seeing her naked figure, the demons began to assault her.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)'
