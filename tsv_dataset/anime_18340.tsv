animeDescription	"Dr. Shinji Ishida is a doctor working at a hospital on the brink of ruin. People have heard that this doctor has brought many hospitals back from financial ruin, however his methods are what you might say ""unorthodox."" After his sessions the patients can't seem to get enough of being treated by him which naturally causes the hospital to be full of money again.
