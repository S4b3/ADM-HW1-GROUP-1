animeDescription	b'Around 1800 years ago in China, the ruling power of the Han dynasty became weakened and the flames of war spread throughout the land. \n\nLiu Bei was a young, poor straw-mat seller from the countryside of Hebai Hsing. After pledging eternal brotherhood with the two heroes, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, Liu began building his idea of a righteous kingdom that would aid citizens who suffered from persecution. \n\n(Source: AniDB)'
