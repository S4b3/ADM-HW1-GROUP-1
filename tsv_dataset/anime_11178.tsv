animeDescription	b'A futon, a traditional Japanese mattress, as seen by Yoriko Mizushiri, becomes the vehicle of dream fantasies combining the most pleasant sensations such as the morning coffee, the warmth of bedding and a soft rice carpet under one\xe2\x80\x99s feet. Lazy stretching serves as a start of sensuous, sleepy gymnastics. With a fluid movement, the passive body will turn once again from the left to the right of the mattress to dive into the fantasies of even deeper unconsciousness a little while later.\n\n(Source: Krakow Film Festival)'
