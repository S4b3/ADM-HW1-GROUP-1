Worshipped as the mother of the land, the wall delivers celestial gift capsules called ""Rakuho\'\' to locations across the continent. Arriving once a month, the capsules contain metallic armbands that allow the wearer to transform into a mechanical being known as a ""Briheight."" As a result, Lingalind is thrown into constant turmoil by its warring nations, all hoping to strengthen their military prowess by procuring the offerings for themselves.\n\nOne day, a Rakuho crash-lands in the countryside with an unexpected inhabitant\xe2\x80\x94a mysterious black-haired man. All eyes are set on this strange newcomer, who calls himself ""Back Arrow,"" when he claims to have hailed from a place beyond the wall\xe2\x80\x94a revelation that can potentially unravel Lingalind\'s entire dogmatic foundation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
