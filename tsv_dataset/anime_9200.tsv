On this robot mountain, Astro saves a robot soldier, Bemu, that escaped from the verge of death and takes him back to Earth. \n\n""I\'m tried of fighting!"" ""I feel the same."" While Atom and Bemu are together, a warm friendship is born and goes on to deepen. However, one day, the trash star draws near to the Earth. If it hits, the Earth would have a huge explosion. The Earth is in chaos. As this happens, there is just one way to stop the crash into Earth. Only this is... What will Astro do.
