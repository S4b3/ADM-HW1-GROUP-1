animeDescription	b'Hibiya Amamiya has experienced the worst loss possible: the life of a friend. For him, the world no longer holds a glimmer, but high school idol Momo Kisaragi has taken it upon herself to show him that there is a reason to go on. Although sadness clings to Hibiya like the full moon which shines through the night, perhaps Momo will be able to brighten his eyes once again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n'
