Satoshi and Gou head toward Aurora Village as research fellows from the Sakuragi Laboratory in order to look into the connection between Suicune and the auroras. There, they meet a girl named Emma, whose father is an aurora researcher, as well as the many Pokémon who live out there in the snowy fields. But the Rocket-Dan appear before Satoshi and the others to get Pikachu! Will our heroes be able to reach the auroras and meet Suicune after all!?
