animeDescription	"After being defeated by the leader of the Beimu clan, Mount Xuandu's chief disciple Shen Qiao falls off a cliff and nearly dies from his injuries. Unfortunately, the ruthless Cleansing Moon sect leader Yan Wushi, known for his cunning and skills, chances upon him and comes up with a sinister plan: turn the benevolent disciple into a vengeful cultivator who could one day become a worthy rival.

Shen Qiao is thrown headfirst into a world of betrayal and deception, contrasting with his once-strong beliefs that good could exist in everyone. As he encounters further hardships that push him to his wits' end, Shen Qiao is faced with the decision of continuing to uphold his kind nature—despite the cruel reality he has been shown—or giving in to the deceitful scheme of the spiteful Yan Wushi.
