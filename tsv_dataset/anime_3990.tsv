animeDescription	"b'In 2019, following an uprising in the USA and a subsequent global nuclear war, humanity was decimated by a catastrophe called ""The Maelstr\xc3\xb6m."" A half-century after this cataclysmic event\xe2\x80\x94to preserve humankind\xe2\x80\x94the World Health Organization (WHO) has progressively assimilated worldwide political power and completely redefined society: people are now considered public resources and are guaranteed a happier life. The heightened development of medicine, nanomachine technology, and augmented reality promote this greater devotion to human health.\n\nSuffocated by the excessive kindness of Japanese society, high school student Miach Mihie decides to oppose the societal values she considers dehumanizing before the health implant surveillance system WatchMe activates itself the day she turns 18. Miach plans to kill herself with two of her friends, Tuan Kirie and Cian Reikadou. However, Cian betrays the pact in disagreement with Miach\'s intentions, allowing Tuan to survive her suicide attempt, unlike Miach, who is declared dead.\n\nThirteen years later, now a high-ranking inspector of Helix\xe2\x80\x94an organization affiliated with WHO to monitor military conflicts\xe2\x80\x94Tuan is sent back to Japan after her drug smuggling activities in the Niger warzone are discovered by senior Helix inspector Oscar Stauffenberg. On her first day back to the country she tried running away from, thousands of people simultaneously commit suicide. Tuan is now in charge of investigating this wave of mass suicide and exposing the terrorist organization behind the unprecedented attack.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
