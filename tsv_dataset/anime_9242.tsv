animeDescription	"b'Milk-chan is a girl who lives in a house stuck on the side of a building with her two sidekicks: Tetsu-ko, a paranoid robot that looks like a bottle and Hanage, a green blob with a mustache.\n\nMilk is poor and she can\'t pay the rent, especially after her attempt to extort a local ant family fails. However, she is saved because the president himself offers her a job (some sort of a secret mission). Milk-chan answers the phone to receive missions from The President by saying something like ""Hello, Bank of Hokkaido. Just kidding!""\n\nAfter getting her mission, Milk-chan and her sidekicks take off aboard the ""Milk-6"" helicopter to go on her mission. Did I tell you this is a spoof of 1970s spy thrillers or some sort of Bond movies?\n\n(Source: AniDB)'"
