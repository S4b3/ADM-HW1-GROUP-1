animeDescription	"Wasted from the night before, Kaede wakes up the next morning to find herself at home with a dinosaur she had brought along with her. The two start living together as an odd pair consisting of a typical gal girl and a mute dinosaur going about daily lives. Although not the most experienced paleontologist, Kaede begins to learn more about her new prehistoric roommate through a series of comedic gags and adventures.
