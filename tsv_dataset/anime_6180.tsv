animeDescription	"b""The city of Tajimi is well-renowned for its Mino ware ceramics and being the hometown of Himeno Toyokawa's mother. Considered a legend in the world of pottery, Himeno's mother suddenly passed away when Himeno was four. However, her legacy lives on in the dozens of unique mugs that adorn the Toyokawas' new restaurant in Tajimi.\n\nHaving moved back to the city recently following the bankruptcy of her father's company in Tokyo, Himeno brings some of her mother's mugs to her first day of high school in an attempt to make friends. One person who immediately takes an interest is Mika Kukuri, an eccentric girl in Himeno's class who soon introduces her to Tooko Aoki, the president of the Pottery Club. After learning more about her mother's contributions to the club and the art form, Himeno asks her father for permission to join, which he gladly gives.\n\nAlongside Mika and her childhood friend Naoko Naruse, Himeno enters the Pottery Club to continue her mother's beloved work and discover her own passion for the craft.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
