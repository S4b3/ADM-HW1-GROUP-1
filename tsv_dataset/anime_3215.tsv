animeDescription	b'Somewhere in the school at noon, one might hear the sound of two girls playing table tennis together as they wait for time to pass by.\n\nAs if by fate, two students\xe2\x80\x94Sakura Adachi and Hougetsu Shimamura\xe2\x80\x94stumble upon each other on the second floor of the school gymnasium. As they gradually foster a budding friendship, their feelings for one another only become more ambiguous. Growing closer by the day, the two must learn to navigate their contrasting personalities as well as determine the depth of their affection for each other.\n\nThe nature of this relationship gradually shifts when one of them starts to develop feelings beyond the boundaries of a platonic relationship. Even so, Adachi and Shimamura must realize if forming a bond stronger than friendship will bring them closer or tear them apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'
