animeDescription	b'A Long time ago, a curse was cast upon the Rindo family. The curse: the family could only give birth to girls. The only way to temporarily lift the curse was to have a child with someone from the Hizuki family. Once the curse was lifted, it would haunt the family again every 3rd generation. Many years have passed and now, Naoto Rindo will be the unfortunate one. His former fianc\xc3\xa9, Suzune Hizuki has passed away due to a tragic accident and now he must impregnate one of the other four girls from the Hizuki family, however, time is running short.\n\nBut wait, did Suzune really die? Mysteries abound around what exactly did happen and will happen since Suzune is still alive.'
