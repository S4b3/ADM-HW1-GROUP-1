animeDescription	b'Something like cooking contests in anime form. Approximately three minutes long per episode, in each story there is an evaluation judgement about preparing home food. The preparation is described as humorously as possible. Funny wordplays are often mentioned several times in a consequence and are particularly salient but are repeated in a merry way.\n\n(Source: AniDB)'
