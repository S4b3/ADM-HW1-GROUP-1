animeDescription	"Takara Tomy's popular doll ""Licca-chan"" got it's own animation ""Licca-chan and the Magical World"" produced by DLE Inc.

This time the theme is a telephone, based on Licca-chan's (Rika-chan's) phone, and the story has elements that capture the girls' hearts such as Magic and Becoming a Princess.

As supporting characters there's the vivid colored ""Bear"", a humorous take on princess as ""Ann Queen"" (voiced by Asa Komuro) and other original characters, creating an original scenario.
