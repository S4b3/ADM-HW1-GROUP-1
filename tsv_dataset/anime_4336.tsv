animeDescription	"On a lively December day at Ashford Academy, the students are joyously preparing for tomorrowâ€™s school festival. However, the celebrations come to an abrupt halt when terrorists strike the academy. The students are taken hostage and put under lockdown as militant remnants of the Neo-Chinese Federation seize control of the school.

Little do the aggressors realize that among the student body are those with extraordinary powers, including the Geass-wielding Lelouch Lamperouge and Britannian soldier Suzaku Kururugi. To protect their school and restore the peace, Lelouch and the student council must band together again to bring about one last miracle.
