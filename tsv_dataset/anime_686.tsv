animeDescription	"b'Within the domed city of Romdo lies one of the last human civilizations on Earth. Thousands of years ago, a global ecological catastrophe doomed the planet; now, life outside these domes is virtually impossible. To expedite mankind\'s recovery, ""AutoReivs,"" humanoid-like robots, have been created to assist people in their day-to-day lives. However, AutoReivs have begun contracting an enigmatic disease called the ""Cogito Virus"" which grants them self-awareness. Re-l Mayer, granddaughter of Romdo\'s ruler, is assigned to investigate this phenomenon alongside her AutoReiv partner Iggy. But what begins as a routine investigation quickly spirals into a conspiracy as Re-l is confronted by humanity\'s darkest sins.\n\nElsewhere in Romdo, an AutoReiv specialist by the name of Vincent Law must also face his demons when surreal events begin occurring around him. Re-l, Iggy, Vincent, and the child AutoReiv named Pino, will form an unlikely faction as they struggle to uncover Romdo\'s mysteries and ultimately, discover the true purpose of the mythical beings called ""Proxies.""\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
