The population decreased to the lowest number ever seen...until only the women were left alive.\n\nThey live huddled in small corners of a world mostly reclaimed by nature.\nThere are those who accept their inevitable extinction and live a carefree life...\nThere are those who try to continue on the race with the help of science...\nIt is a society of constant conflict over their differences of principles and policies.\n\nThe story takes place in the center of Tokyo. It is one of the places left for them. The conflict over the specimen of ""ICE"" and the chance it may provide to save humanity begins. \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)'"
