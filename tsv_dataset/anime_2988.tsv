animeDescription	"b""As the Holy Empire rises to power, the neighboring lands begin to gradually fall under its control. The Empire's conquest eventually reaches the small island of Erin, home to the Gael tribe. There, a priestess named Riannon is kidnapped to be offered as a living sacrifice to the demon king Arawn, a malevolent being rumored to have caused untold destruction in the past.\n\nRiannon's brother, First Warrior Arthur, rescues her, when Arawn suddenly materializes before them as a handsome grey-haired man. Hiding his true identity and remaining enigmatic, Arawn pledges his power and leadership to the tribe's cause and joins Arthur, Riannon, and their merry band of friends\xe2\x80\x94including a talented swordsman, an agile hunter, and a group of ecstatic pixies\xe2\x80\x94as they fight back against the Empire, while uncovering the dark secrets of the land along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"""
