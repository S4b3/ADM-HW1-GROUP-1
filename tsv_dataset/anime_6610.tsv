animeDescription	"Kubota Makoto and Tokitoh Minoru (characters from Kazuya Minekura's manga Wild Adaptor—though no reference is made to the darker storyline of WA in this light-hearted anime)—are the muscle of their high school's all-powerful student council. They defend the student body from disorder—generated by both humans and demons—while avoiding their classes.
