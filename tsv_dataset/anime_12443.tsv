animeDescription	"b'Norakuro is a black dog enlisted in the ""Mokenrentai"" (Fierce Dog Brigade), an Imperial army of dogs fighting in a war against the enemy Monkey Army.\n\nNorakuro is a stray black-and-white dog in an army of white dogs who blundered his way while being a Private Second-Class.\n\nThis series  was relatively faithful to the comics. One big change, however, was the addition of the army nurse Miko, whom Norakuro had a crush on. For this series, Norakuro was voiced by Nobuyo Ooyama, who would later become noted for voicing Doraemon.\n\n(Source: Cartoon Research)'"
