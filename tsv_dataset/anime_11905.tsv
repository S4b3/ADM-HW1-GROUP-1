animeDescription	"Symbolized an urban man with a triangle figure, a country woman with a circle, and represented the encounter between the two by movement.

Director Shigenji Ogino tried to naturally color the movie via the kinema color technique. Due to being an early work, the technique isn't smooth. Because of this the film has a photosensitive epileptic seizure warning as there are high frequency flashes of red and green frames for the duration of the entire film. 

Please be careful while viewing."
