animeDescription	"b'Due to the advent of modern technology, kids have abandoned their crayons and paper for electronic tablets, causing the imaginative energy emitted from children\'s doodles to reach an all-time low. Consequently, the Rakuga Kingdom in the sky, powered by such energy, is now at risk of collapsing onto the cities below. For any hope to avoid such a catastrophe, the kingdom\'s princess hastily seeks out a hero from Earth capable of wielding the ""Miracle Crayon."" \n\nWhile the kingdom\'s reformers arrive on land to seize Earth, the magical crayon finds itself in the hands of Shinnosuke ""Shin-chan"" Nohara. In a journey that will test the limits of childlike imagination, Shin-chan must harness his creativity to secure the safety of his home and restore peace to both worlds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]'"
