animeDescription	"Once upon a time the Chuang family chopped firewood for a living. Mother Tanja spent three years day and night weaving this tapestry. One day a wind storm came and the tapestry flew away. Kam Tong, one of the children, would venture off to the dangerous Tibet mountains to try to get the tapestry back. Very few have ever survived the cave.
