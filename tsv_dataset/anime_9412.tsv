animeDescription	"An incomplete storyboard rests on a desk. Within it, are a boy and girl who suddenly jump to life and escape the confines of the sheet of paper in order to kickstart their storyâ€”one defined by their own actions. As they journey across the desk, the world around them begins to transform and signals the start of their vivid new adventure.
