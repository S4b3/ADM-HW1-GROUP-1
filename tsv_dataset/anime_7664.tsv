animeDescription	"Medaka is a high school student. She wants to be a doctor, and sheâ€™s just transferred to Tanaka Private School on the recommendation of her parents.

But she finds that his school looks a bit strange. For example, Pochi is such a smart student who always gets full marks, but he is a dog. And there are other classmates: Nekoko, a cat, who thinks of Pochi as a rival, Misa, a five-years-old girl. Of course, her home room teacher, Mr. Tanaka, is not normal. His face is ... A fish?!
