Welcome to our third homework repository!

A better visualization of our notebook can be found here:   
```https://nbviewer.org/github/S4b3/ADM-HW3-Group1/tree/main/```   

If you want to run the notebook make sure to see if you have installed all the libraries we used.

For better comprehension we have extracted all of our functions inside three different modules:

- `scraping_utils.py`
- `indexing_utils.py`
- `query_utils.py` 

Every module has been documented, so feel free to read the documentation to understand the code more easily.

During the homework we extracted many documents that have been placed under different folders in our repository, in particular:

- `./dataset/` contains all of the html we downloaded divided by page
- `./tsv_dataset/` contains the informations we have extracted from the html for every anime
- `./preprocessed_dataset/` contains the preprocessed animes in json format
- `./indexes/` contains our two different inverted indexes

At root level, you can also find `vocabulary.json` which is our vocabulary.
